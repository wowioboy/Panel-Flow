<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">When the evening of Jyk's first professional fight finally came, he was near to bursting with excitement.  He'd managed to stay out of any significant trouble for the past two span, testing his patience to its limit.  He was fine as long as he was working, training, or carving, but every moment in between activities was lost in a haze of misery and self-loathing.  He'd almost cut a finger off when he had noticed that the peak of a small tower he was carving from a hunk of oak had started to morph into the head of a woman under his meditative knife.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now, he was standing with Delk and Ellis in one of the warm-up rooms that lined the outer walls of Tarranton Arena.  Clad in nothing put a loose pair of pants and strips of cloth wrapped around his knuckles, Jyk had just finished a round of shadow boxing that left him glistening with sweat.  The recent lash wounds on his back were red and angry, but they had healed sufficiently closed a few days beforehand and he did not expect to have any trouble out of them.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, what's the story on my opponent?,&rdquo; Jyk asked Ellis.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ellis shrugged slightly.  &ldquo;Well, we have five divisions in total.  Silas was pretty high up in the rankings of the fifth before you broke his arm, so I figured we'd try you out against someone midway up the fourth division ladder.  He's only a couple years older than you and pretty similar in build so it should prove an effective test for both of you.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk nodded as he continued to bounce up and down, keeping his muscles warm.  &ldquo;So if I beat him you put me in the fourth division, if I lose I get knocked down to the fifth?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ellis gave a small smile.  &ldquo;That's the gist of it.&rdquo;  He gave a nod to the man that peeked his head into the room.  &ldquo;Looks like they're ready for you,&rdquo; he said with a toothy grin.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk began the long walk down to the pit just as the scrawny orator standing amidst the dirt began his introduction.  &ldquo;Coming to the pit now is Jyk Pevnal, a newcomer to professional fighting!,&rdquo; he bellowed to the crowd.  &ldquo;But don't let yourself think that he was pushed into the fourth division by mistake, he broke fifth division's Silas Stinger's arm during what started as a friendly sparring match!&rdquo;  Jyk hopped down into the pit and raised his arms to a smattering of weak cheers as the orator pointed in his direction.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">For his opponent,&rdquo; the man continued loudly, &ldquo;with a record of five wins with no losses, we have Tarranton's newest knockout artist:  Mikal 'The Hammer' Mallown!&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk watched nervously as a well muscled man less than a stone heavier than him strolled calmly forward and hopped into the pit amidst a raucous welcome from the spectators.  Jyk had watched a few fights in the two span since meeting Ellis and this was the most cheering he had heard for a fighter introduction.  <em><span style="text-decoration: none;">Great</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;">, thought Jyk, </span><em><span style="text-decoration: none;">he set me up against the fan favorite</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">The orator walked to the exact center of the pit and motioned for both fighters to join him there.  &ldquo;Alright boys,&rdquo; he said once they had reached him, &ldquo;simple rules.  No nut-shots, no eye gouging.  Rounds are ten minutes and the fight continues until someone is knocked out, submitted, or otherwise unable to continue competing.  Understood?&rdquo;  Once they had both nodded their understanding, he bobbed his head excitedly.  &ldquo;Alright then, retreat to the walls and come out fighting.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk bumped fists with is opponent and they slowly backpedaled until the orator-turned-referee held his palms up for them to stop.  After holding them up for a few moments he dropped them quickly to signify the beginning of the bout.  Jyk slowly paced forward to meet Mikal in the middle, his nerves jangling.  Most of the fights he had witnessed began with the fighters pecking lightly at each other to get a feel for the opponent's strengths and weaknesses.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">After their first casual exchange of blocked jabs, Jyk understood why they called him 'The Hammer'. </span><em><span style="text-decoration: none;"> Either this guy doesn't know how to hold back his full strength</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;">, he thought, parrying another couple of jabs and returning them in kind, </span><em><span style="text-decoration: none;">or he's as strong enough for a guy twice his size</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;">.  It didn't take long for Mikal to decide to ratchet up the pressure and Jyk soon found himself losing control of the fight and being pursued about the pit. </span><em><span style="text-decoration: none;"> Bugger this</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;">.  He ducked a looping hook and landed a couple of hard shots to Mikal's gut before darting back a couple of steps.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The look of frustration of Mikal's face as he closed the distance between them told Jyk something he had begun to wonder about since the orator called his opponent a 'knockout artist'. </span><em><span style="text-decoration: none;">I bet it won't be hard to lure him into a haymaker and leave himself open.  I wonder how good his chin is</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;">.  In order to test his hypothesis, Jyk decided to stick with the strategy that put the irritated look on Mikal's face in the first place:  ducking, sticking, and moving.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">After a few more exchanges, Jyk realized that his opponent had not managed to land anything beyond a glancing blow. </span><em><span style="text-decoration: none;">He's not getting any faster,</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;"> he realized.  After another exchange, he corrected himself. </span><em><span style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Actually, he's downright slow</span></span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">.  Jyk added a little more sticking into his strategy, quickening his combinations and twice he even putt a fist on Mikal's jaw.  When the look of frustration turned into wrath, Jyk knew his opening would be coming along shortly.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mikal strode forward quickly and started into a wild combination.  Jyk managed to parry aside a flurry of hard jabs and read the telegraphed right hook that was coming at him with everything 'The Hammer' had to put behind it.  Jyk bent at the knees, ducking with a neat crouch, his mouth stretching into a grin as he felt the rush of air as a powerful right hook swung harmlessly above his head.  When the space above him was almost clear, Jyk threw a sharp left hook around into Mikal's kidney and sprang back to his full height, driving his leg strength behind a vicious right uppercut.  Fist found purchase under The Hammer's jaw, lifting him from his feet and sending him sprawling onto his back.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk kept his guard raised until the referee waved his hands wide signaling a knockout, then raised them high in the air amidst a chorus of cheers and boos.  Spreading his arms wide he found Ellis in the crowd and heaved a shrug in that direction.  As he climbed out of the pit, Ellis hurried forward to give him a hand up and lead him back into the room where he had warmed up. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk was waiting there for him, a wide smile on his face.  &ldquo;Did he even <em>hit</em> you?,&rdquo; asked a visibly excited Delk.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk couldn't suppress a chuckle.  &ldquo;A couple shots brushed my chin, but nothing straight on.  He was too slow to get anything worthwhile past my guard.&rdquo;  He shrugged and took a slow breath.  &ldquo;I will say that I've never blocked a jab nearly as strong as his, though.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ellis shook his head in wonderment.  &ldquo;My boy, I think you are a legitimate freak of nature.  You seem to be as fast as someone two stone lighter and as strong as someone two stone heavier.  The Hammer was only a couple of fights away from a title shot and you knocked him cold in under four minutes.&rdquo;  He flipped a silver tala towards Jyk, who deftly snatched it out of the air and raised it in front of his eyes for inspection.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">I've never actually held one of these before,&rdquo; he said, turning the coin in his hand repeatedly and staring at the crown on one side and tower on the other.  It was several long moments before he snapped out of his reverie and pocketed the coin.  &ldquo;So what's the plan for my next fight?,&rdquo; he asked.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ellis laughed loudly.  &ldquo;Well shit, I'm kind of at a loss there.  With you dispatching your two opponents so quickly it's kind of hard to gauge who to pit you up against.&rdquo;  He tapped at his chin thoughtfully.  &ldquo;Y'know, I do have <em>one</em> idea.  You feel up for a second bout in a couple of hours?&rdquo;  He pulled out a silver pocket watch and checked the time.  &ldquo;Or do you need to get back to the castle and catch some sleep before your duties?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk shrugged.  &ldquo;Kayla was kind enough to reschedule my day out this month for tomorrow in case I needed the time to recover.  I've got energy enough to fight every bout on the card between now and dawn.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ellis grinned widely, shaking his head again.  &ldquo;How a born warrior like you gets stuck in the servants' dungeon for life baffles me.  It should've been Varlin's knee you were bounced upon as a baby, not some servant.&rdquo;  He was still shaking his head as he began making his way towards the door.  &ldquo;Cool down, but stay loose.  I'll be back in a little bit to tell you whether or not I can get you another fight tonight.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">When Ellis left the room, Delk immediately walked over to Jyk and clapped him on the shoulder with a hearty laugh.  &ldquo;I knew you were talented, kid, but <em>damn</em>.  I've seen The Hammer fight before and lemme tell you, he <em>ain't</em> slow, you just made him look that way.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk shrugged casually.  &ldquo;So a fighter like him is considered fast at my size?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk laughed again.  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he responded flatly.  &ldquo;Not lightning fast, but he's pretty quick.  And I <em>thought</em> he was too tough to get dropped by the first hard punch he took on the chin.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk shrugged again.  &ldquo;That uppercut had my legs behind it on top of my normal arm strength.  It probably looked a lot more impressive than it was.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk shook his head in a manner very similar to the wonderment Ellis had shown.  &ldquo;You really are something else, Jyk.  Ellis is right, they should've had Varlin raise you, not Kayla.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk scrunched his brow.  &ldquo;How does he know Master-at-arms Varlin, anyways?,&rdquo; he asked confusedly.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ellis started out as a private in the Tarrant Guard.  Varlin was the staff sergeant that rode his ass for the entirety of his short-lived military career.  He used what he learned from being a member of a standing army and slowly built a small local fighting circuit into this underground palace for gladiatorial combat.  Now fighters from all over Tathren come here to compete under Ellis's watchful eye.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">The roar of the crowd suddenly grew loud in the warm-up room, then quiet again as Ellis closed the door behind himself.  &ldquo;Alright, Jyk, I've got a proposition for you.  The top contender for the title in Division Four is in the house as a spectator tonight.  I was going to throw him a couple of challenging fights before I would be comfortable giving him a title shot, but now I think that a bout between the two of you is all I need to see.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk's eyes widened.  &ldquo;Your top contender?  Pyke?&rdquo;  When Ellis nodded silently, Delk rounded on Jyk.  &ldquo;Think hard about this one, Jyk.  Pyke has easily three stone and four inches on you to go with his fifteen professional fights and extremely nasty temperament.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk tried and failed to look concerned for Delk's sake.  He mustered a halfhearted shrug.  &ldquo;Meh, I've been fighting guys bigger, more experienced, and nastier than me since I was old enough to throw a punch.  Besides, since it looks like I'm gonna be fighting in his division I'm gonna have to fight him sometime.  Why not now?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">You just fought.,&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Raavi;"><span style="font-size: small;">I used more energy warming up than in the fight.&rdquo;  He turned to Ellis.  &ldquo;I'm in.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
