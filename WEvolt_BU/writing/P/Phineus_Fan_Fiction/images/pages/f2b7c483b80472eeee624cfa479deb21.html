Dialog progresses as they drive.]<br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;How much do you suppose handsomely is; in U.S. currency?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Seems a little off to me. Too easy maybe.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;No biggy, we just dig up a vampire. Deliver. Get paid. This is the stuff we&rsquo;ve been dreamin&rsquo; about gettin.&rsquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s check out Professor Moltaire while we&rsquo;re at it.

I&rsquo;ve not yet seen a man with the possibilities he has. None, other than myself, has shown the promise of immortality. My regret is that he cannot be trusted. There is good in him and I will destroy it and consume his powers. Phineus must die.&rdquo;<br /><br />Several hours after beginning the search, Phineus and Sarah head for the shipyard; empty-handed.<br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. Not an inkling of who or what Professor Moltaire is.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope he&rsquo;s got as much cash as he lets on.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Well, the only way to find out is to do what the man says.&rdquo;<br />[Phineus and Sarah get out of their car at a partly dismantled dock.]<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong>/<strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Vampires.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;You think sniffin&rsquo; &lsquo;em out will be as easy as snuffin&rsquo; &lsquo;em out. We never tried to take one along peaceful-like.&rdquo;<br /><br />[ Phineus and Sarah creep through the usual places; ducking under piping and kicking open doors.]<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Might be hard to just ask a vampire out to dinner; given our reputation.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Here we are;<br />[Phineus spins around to face Chantier.]<br />just the three of us.&rdquo;<br /><br />Chantier (Shon-tee-yay)<br />&ldquo;You two do not look as I expected.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong>/<strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;You know us?&rdquo;<br /><br />Chantier<br />&ldquo;Of you, more so. I&rsquo;ve allowed you to find me; because...&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Allowed?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;Pardon me. Because I need your help.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Who found whom?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think someone of my caliber would be caught dead in a place like this; do you.?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Well...&rdquo;<br />[Chantier begins leading Phineus and Sarah out to their car.]<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;You must start associating with a better class of undead.

You need to learn to fly.&rdquo;<br />[Chantier takes off.]<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Where are ...?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;Cafe Express.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Maybe a vampire will invite us to dinner.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;As long as he&rsquo;s buyin&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />[View from building tops; down at Phineus and Sarah&rsquo;s car.]<br /><br />Phineus and Sarah find themselves confused and apprehensive about the case thusfar. They can&rsquo;t trust Professor Moltaire and they never believe a word from the mouth of a vampire. So why do both need their help? When they sit down with Chantier they&rsquo;re ready for some answers.<br /><br />[All three are seated at a table inside Cafe Express.]<br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;My name is Chantier. I know Moltaire has sent you. I also know he&rsquo;s in this building and intends to destroy the three of us.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Then you know what he&rsquo;s up to.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;Partly.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;How &lsquo;bout fillin&rsquo; us in.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;Moltaire needs a vampire&rsquo;s blood to complete a ceremony he&rsquo;s been performing on the sixth moon, every one-hundredth year.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Why you, why us?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;Me, because I&rsquo;ve known about his ritual since the 13th century. You... I&rsquo;m not sure. He&rsquo;s never needed anyone&rsquo;s assistance for anything.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my magic he&rsquo;s after.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;The dreams.&rdquo;<br />[Phineus leaves the cafe; entranced.]<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;Moltaire calls.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;This is gonna ruin a perfectly eventless week.&rdquo;<br /><br />[Inside Moltaire&rsquo;s Ritual Chamber. Moltaire is dressed &lsquo;Merlinesque&rsquo; and Phineus is levitating in the center of the room.]<br /><strong>Moltaire</strong><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only weekness, Phineus, is that you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to die; and now you will.&rdquo;<br />[Moltaire picks up a sabre from a table filled with ancient weapons.]<br />&ldquo;Tools... of warriors from the past. Ours... magic. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem unsettling to sever the hands of goodness?&rdquo;<br /><br />[Moltaire circles Phineus as he talks. Phineus&rsquo;s body rotates to keep facing Moltaire.]<br /><strong>Moltaire</strong><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re speechless; I know. Nothing you would say could matter. Adieu, Phineus; and thanks for the vampire.&rdquo;<br />[Moltaire draws the sabre back to strike.]<br />&ldquo;Lox et, lo vai.&rdquo;<br /><br />[Moltaire slashes the sabre toward Phineus. Sarah and Chantier burst into the chamber and Sarah shoots Phineus in the shoulder. Phineus&rsquo;s body is thrown against the wall. Chantier lunges onto Moltaire grabbing his hair and pulling his head to the side.]<br /><br /><strong>Chantier</strong><br />&ldquo;Good night, sweet Sarah.&rdquo;<br />[Chantier bites Moltaire on the neck.]<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Phineus, kill Chantier; Now!&rdquo;<br />[Phineus lifts his arm and &ldquo;zaps&rdquo; Chantier disintegrating his body. Moltaire raises his arms and screams with fury as his body turns to dust.]<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong>/<strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your mess; you clean it up.&rdquo;<br />[Sarah helps Phineus to his feet.]<br />&ldquo;Sorry I had to shoot ya&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Well, as long as you had to. Hurts a lot though.<br /><br /><strong>Sarah</strong><br />&ldquo;On the way to the hospital, I&rsquo;ll tell ya&rsquo; about how the blood of a dying vampire can kill just about anything.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Phineus</strong><br />&ldquo;Nifty.&rdquo;</p>
