<p>On the first clear day of spring, Moekin rounded the bend in the forest.&nbsp; The sight that greeted him was one that he had been looking forward to for a long time.&nbsp; It had been two years since he had laid eyes on the village of his friends the Tanners.&nbsp; The Halfling village was nestled in a dense part of the forest that was just outside of his hometown of Briarwood.</p>
<p>Approaching the village Moekin noticed that it had grown in the past two years.&nbsp; The small Village Square boasted a new wooden house for the healer, instead of the thatched huts that make up the rest of the homes.&nbsp; The house of the Tanners had not changed though.&nbsp; It still was a squat thatched hut with a small wooden door.&nbsp; That still squeaked, as Meranda came out of the house with a bucket in hand.</p>
