<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">On the first clear day of spring, Moekin rounded the bend in the forest.&nbsp; The sight that greeted him was one that he had been looking forward to for a long time.&nbsp; It had been two years since he had laid eyes on the village of his friends the Tanners.&nbsp; The Halfling village was nestled in a dense part of the forest that was just outside of his hometown of Briarwood.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">Approaching the village Moekin noticed that it had grown in the past two years.&nbsp; The small Village Square boasted a new wooden house for the healer, instead of the thatched huts that make up the rest of the homes.&nbsp; The house of the Tanners had not changed though.&nbsp; It still was a squat thatched hut with a small wooden door.&nbsp; That still squeaked, as Meranda came out of the house with a bucket in hand.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">As she turned to go to the well she saw a human coming down the main path.&nbsp; As this human came closer she dropped her bucket and started to run towards him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Milo, Gabe, come quick.&nbsp; Moekin has returned.&rdquo; She shouted.&nbsp; The two old friends embraced as two Halflings came bursting out the door.&nbsp; The first one out was the shorter of the two.&nbsp; The second one quickly over took the smaller one and came to a crashing halt as he ran into Moekin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Milo, how have you been?&nbsp; I do believe that you have grown a little since I saw you last.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;I have, and I&rsquo;ve also been practicing the hunting skills that you showed me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gotten really good at them also; I actually downed a doe just the other day.&nbsp; I might even be able to keep up with you now.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;We shall see about that little one&rdquo; Moekin stated as he swept the feet out from underneath Milo.&nbsp; Milo came crashing down to the ground with a thud as his little brother Gabe came running up to Moekin and wrapped his arms around Moekin&rsquo;s legs.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Now who is this strapping young man, I don&rsquo;t think that I have had the pleasure of meeting you young sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moekin said as he gave a wink to Meranda.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Sure you have Moekin, it is me Gabe, and I&rsquo;m all grown up now.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be it sure is, you have grown, but not up&rdquo; Moekin said with a laugh.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;But I have, I am only four inches shorter than Milo&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;But still you only come to just above my knee.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">The door to the house burst open and a stout Halfling with barreled chest came stomping out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well you have a lot of nerve showing up here human.&nbsp; What are you doing embracing my wife, human.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that is any of your business Halfling&rdquo; Moekin stated as he marched towards the Halfling.&nbsp; They squared off and stared at each other for a few moments then they both broke out in gruff laughter and embraced each other.&nbsp; The Halfling was no other than Kestel Tanner, long time friend and fellow adventure of Moekin.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Kestel, old man how has the world been treating you this past two years.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not underground yet, so it must be fine.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;It would take an army to bring you down, and even then you would take most of them with you." Moekin said with laughter in his voice.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got that damn right, and with the luck of the gods you would be by my side and we would be victorious.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way that it worked out many times before.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Have you eaten yet?&rdquo; Meranda asked as she approached the two friends.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I was hoping that you would ask me that.&nbsp; I have been looking forward to your cooking for two years.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;We have some meat left over from Milo&rsquo;s kill, come on in and have a seat.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve plenty to catch up on.&rdquo; Kestel said as he turned and started to walk back to the house.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Wait for us.&rdquo; Shouted Gabe</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">Moekin turned just in time to see Milo staring at a young Halfling female as he was walking back to the house and not watching where he was going, Milo tripped and fell flat on his face.&nbsp; The young girl started to giggle and ran off down the street.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Milo&rsquo;s got a girlfriend.&rdquo; Gabe said as he skipped by laughing at his brother.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">Milo jumped up and took a swing at his brother, &ldquo;Do not!&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Boys that is quite enough.&nbsp; Come on your parents are already in the house, come on let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">Milo, Gabe and Moekin walked through the door.</span></span></p>
