<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Would you like seconds?&rdquo; Meranda asked Moekin used a biscuit to sop up the last of the gravy on his plate.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;No thanks, I am stuffed to the hilt.&nbsp; Your cooking always hits the spot.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Dad, tell us again how you single handedly killed that Ancient Red Dragon that was gonna eat Moekin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gabe asked as Meranda cleaned the table.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;So it was ancient, I thought it was a hatchling, and I seem to remember that there were three of us there&rdquo; Moekin said with a chuckle.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Well, uh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Never mind about that, we were just coming to the good part&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;There we were in a clearing on the mountain just past Devil&rsquo;s Peak.&nbsp; When we spotted that damned white hared bastard Dark Elf.&rdquo; Kestel continued on.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Now be careful what you say around the children Kestel.&rdquo; Moekin said.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Sorry, Moekin, I just get so angry about the fact that he got away.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;It was not your fault, my old friend.&nbsp; He was just a sneaky fiend, the way that he led us into that trap with that dragon.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;I know, given the chance we would have had him and his head on a pike to bring back to that poor village that he raided.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Never the less, the Dragon was slain, the Dark Elf did get away.&nbsp; But we rescued the captives and returned them to the village.&nbsp; With that said its way past our bedtime.&nbsp; Milo you need to get up early if you want to go hunting with Moekin.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Can I go to?&rdquo;&nbsp; Gabe Whined.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;No, you are too small.&rdquo;&nbsp; Snorted Milo</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Am not&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">&ldquo;Some day you will be big enough to go.&rdquo; Moekin stated to Gabe with a wink.</span></span></p>
