<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;HOW IS HE?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good, all things considering. The nurse stopped him before he&hellip; before anything too serious could happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raiku blinked, bright light streaming across his face as a nurse fiddled with the blinds&mdash;who? He knew her from&hellip; when? His last visit. Yes, that was right. Ma&hellip; Matha&hellip; Mathania, was her name, right? A Haitian immigrant. Yes. He remembered her from his last visit, when he broke his arm. She was a kind woman, but right now, she was searing his eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried to reach for his face, but his hand was stuck.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuck?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am an adult, Doctor Cross. A grown woman. Don&rsquo;t sugarcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My apologies, Ms. Kaminaga, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His head rolled to the side. Eyes opened. His hand was cuffed to the bed. Had he&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Please. Hirubasa.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;Ms. Hirubasa, I meant no offense. Your nephew, he is&hellip; very sick, but his wounds should heal quite nicely. The scalpel he used was only about a quarter-inch long, so the damage was superficial, really. Just&hellip; be warned. It looks much worse than it is. Twelve&hellip; well, not lacerations. Incisions, really. He&rsquo;ll have scars.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That voice. <em>Oba.</em> His stomach sank, cheeks flowing crimson. His <em>oba </em>was here, to see him like this. As a failure. A prisoner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;Thank you. This medication&hellip; you said it was new? How is it different?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Uhh, yes. Ms&hellip; Hirubasa, how familiar are you with neuroscience?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes fell closed again. His head hurt. His stomach hurt worse. What had he done? What had <em>they</em> done, to draw his aunt back from abroad?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite, by now. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, as you are probably aware, previous medicines worked by modifying the distribution of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with the reward centers of the brain. They&hellip; helped quite a bit with the so-called &lsquo;positive&rsquo; symptoms&mdash;hallucinations, delusions, that sort of thing. But they weren&rsquo;t as much help for the &lsquo;negative&rsquo; symptoms&mdash;blunted emotion, lack of motivation, lack of pleasure. The real kickers. What goes on inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inside? Raiku grit his teeth. The man had no idea. No clue. If aunt Kana wasn&rsquo;t here, he would have&hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;done nothing, in truth. What could he do? What could he say?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what does this new drug do differently?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&hellip; well, everything, really. It regulates glutamate, not dopamine. Glutamate is&hellip; really the main road of communication in the brain. Too much, and you&rsquo;re subject to seizures and your brain cells start to die, among other things. On the other hand, too little can lead to coma, death, and&hellip; psychosis. It&rsquo;s a pretty big deal, really, and what we&rsquo;ve found is that this new drug addresses not only the positive symptoms, but the negative. It should help him function in a real, appreciable way. It won&rsquo;t cause the Parkinsons-like symptoms down the road, either, as tardive dyskinesia is directly tied to dopamine.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great. It wouldn&rsquo;t break his body&mdash;just his soul. His wrists turned in the cuffs, pulling gently, careful not to make a sound. He didn&rsquo;t want the doctor to know. He didn&rsquo;t want to see his face. To have to feign appreciation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see. Thank you, Doctor. Now, may I have some time with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course. Take care, Ms. Hirubasa. I&rsquo;ll be available if you have any questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raiku took a deep breath. Clenched his eyes tighter. He didn&rsquo;t want to see her face. Her disappointment. Her shame.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her guilt.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Raiku?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His toes wriggled, feet pulling subtly against their restraints. His eyes opened slowly, hesitantly. He stared at the wall. &ldquo;&hellip;<em>Obasan</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&hellip; heard you were arrested. At the mall. I came as quickly as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His lips parted to speak, but he had nothing to say. They closed again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The doctor said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;Oh. Alright. Well, that&rsquo;s good, right? I know you were worried about the side effects, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He pursed his lips, fingers balling into fists. &ldquo;Why does nobody ask <em>me</em>? I don&rsquo;t&hellip; <em>fuckin&rsquo;</em> want &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;Raiku, you&rsquo;re already on the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>No.</em> <em>More. Drugs.</em> Who <em>are </em>they, anyway? Who says they can tell me what I&rsquo;m sposeda see, or think, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Raiku, please. Look at yourself. How do you think you got&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you even doing here? You come all this way just to get on my case, like I don&rsquo;t already know what you want?! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His face reeled back with a loud smack, pain surging through his porcelain cheek.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Obasan&hellip;</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Christ sake, Raiku! I did not travel ten thousand miles to have you spit in my face!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, you listen to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kana&rsquo;s fingers clenched his jaw. She pulled his face toward hers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small, dainty features, twisted in hurt and rage. Almond eyes, creased with the first signs of age. Straight, jet-black hair, shoulder length. His aunt had always seemed frail, in body, but few dared to cross her.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you even know what you did to yourself?! To others?! The man from the mall, the one you punched in the face, needed six stitches in his lip. Six! There&rsquo;s a nurse with a black eye, and the monitor&hellip; <em>thing</em> you broke, it cost the hospital <em>thousands</em>. But you know what really bothers me in all of this, Raiku? Do you know what hurts me most?!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raiku bit his lip. Shook his head. His eyes widened a bit as his aunt reached for his cuffs, ripping them off the bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grasping his hospital-issued top, she yanked it up. She reached for his head. Clenching his hair, she pulled forward, as if demanding he look for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodding quickly with a wince, he tried to push himself up. The skin on his abdomen cried out in protest, and he timidly glanced down.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His stomach was covered in gauze. From just above his groin to the flesh over his ribs, he was sewn, padded, and taped. He couldn&rsquo;t see what had happened, but his brief motion was more than enough to feel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&hellip; <em>this</em>, all of this, it&rsquo;s <em>my fault</em>. That I can&rsquo;t be here to watch you. To keep you safe. And that I trusted you, for just a moment, to take care of yourself. I lied to myself, Raiku. And it hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raiku fell silent. His fingers trailed across his side, across his bandages. He didn&rsquo;t remember doing this. He hardly remembered the mall. There was a man, whom he&rsquo;d hit, for some reason. A curious woman. A kind stranger, who helped him after he tripped. Glass in his head.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a nightmare. The hospital. <em>Ojiichan</em>. <em>Kaasan</em>. His&hellip; uncle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His lip quivered. He sank back, eyes trailing off to the wall, again. Fingertips grasped the bedsheets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long silence, the elder Hirubasa sighed quietly. &ldquo;What&hellip; <em>happened</em>, Rai-kun? Why would you do this to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raiku closed his eyes. Swallowed hard. &ldquo;&hellip;My&hellip; your hus&hellip; <em>Kaminaga,</em> he&hellip; blamed me. Mom, too. Wanted to know why I&hellip; didn&rsquo;t sa&hellip; s-save&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His aunt drew in a sharp breath. Her fingers began to tremble, and she held a hand over his lips, shaking her head. &ldquo;That&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t real, Raiku. You were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t tell me what&rsquo;s real!!</em>&rdquo; His eyes shot back to hers, moisture welling within. &ldquo;It was real to me! Don&rsquo;t you get it?! All of it, everything I see, it&rsquo;s <em>all <strong>real TO ME!</strong></em>&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused. Glanced down. Smiled softly. &ldquo;What&hellip; what my husband did, Rai-kun&hellip; was no one&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes moistened. He held up a hand, began to speak, to protest.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>No.</em>&rdquo; Stepping slowly around the bed, she shook her head again. Knelt next to his face. &ldquo;No. You know what you did do, Rai-kun? You saved <em>me</em>. Fourteen years old, and you saved my <em>life</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Oba... </em>I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother wouldn&rsquo;t blame you for that.&rdquo; Leaning closer, his aunt wrapped her arms around his shoulders, cupping his head in one hand. Fingertips leafed through the snow-white roots of his hair. &ldquo;You know as well as I do, Rai-chan, that your mother would thank God, Himself, that He gave her a son so brave. And that&hellip; <em>that</em> is why I tell you, it wasn&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raiku looked down. His vision blurred. Weak hands trailed slowly around his aunt&rsquo;s tiny frame, holding her as his eyes began to overflow. First gently, then as tight as he could. His throat tightened. His chest burned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the first time in two years, he sobbed.&nbsp;</p>
