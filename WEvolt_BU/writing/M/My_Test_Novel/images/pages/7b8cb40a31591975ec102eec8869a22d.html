<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">On the first clear day of spring, Moekin rounded the bend in the forest. &nbsp;The sight that greeted him was one that he had been looking forward to for a long time. &nbsp;It had been two years since he had laid eyes on the village of his friends the Tanners. &nbsp;The Halfling village was nestled in a dense part of the forest that was just outside of his hometown of Briarwood.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Approaching the village Moekin noticed that it had grown in the past two years. &nbsp;The small Village Square boasted a new wooden house for the healer, instead of the thatched huts that make up the rest of the homes. &nbsp;The house of the Tanners had not changed though. &nbsp;It still was a squat thatched hut with a small wooden door. &nbsp;That still squeaked, as Meranda came out of the house with a bucket in hand.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">As she turned to go to the well she saw a human coming down the main path. &nbsp;As this human came closer she dropped her bucket and started to run towards him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Milo, Gabe, come quick. &nbsp;Moekin has returned.&rdquo; She shouted. &nbsp;The two old friends embraced as two Halflings came bursting out the door. &nbsp;The first one out was the shorter of the two. &nbsp;The second one quickly over took the smaller one and came to a crashing halt as he ran into Moekin. &nbsp;&ldquo;Milo, how have you been? &nbsp;I do believe that you have grown a little since I saw you last.&rdquo;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;I have, and I&rsquo;ve also been practicing the hunting skills that you showed me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve gotten really good at them also; I actually downed a doe just the other day. &nbsp;I might even be able to keep up with you now.&rdquo;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;We shall see about that little one&rdquo; Moekin stated as he swept the feet out from underneath Milo. &nbsp;Milo came crashing down to the ground with a thud as his little brother Gabe came running up to Moekin and wrapped his arms around Moekin&rsquo;s legs.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;Now who is this strapping young man, I don&rsquo;t think that I have had the pleasure of meeting you young sir.&rdquo; &nbsp;Moekin said as he gave a wink to Meranda.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;Sure you have Moekin, it is me Gabe, and I&rsquo;m all grown up now.&rdquo;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be it sure is, you have grown, but not up&rdquo; Moekin said with a laugh.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;But I have, I am only four inches shorter than Milo&rdquo;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;But still you only come to just above my knee.&rdquo;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The door to the house burst open and a stout Halfling with barreled chest came stomping out. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well you have a lot of nerve showing up here human. &nbsp;What are you doing embracing my wife, human.&rdquo;</div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Moekin turned just in time to see Milo staring at a young Halfling female as he was walking back to the house and not watching where he was going, Milo tripped and fell flat on his face. &nbsp;The young girl started to giggle and ran off down the street.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">&ldquo;Milo&rsquo;s got a girlfriend.&rdquo; Gabe said as he skipped by laughing at his brother.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Milo jumped up and took a swing at his brother, &ldquo;Do not!&rdquo;</div>
