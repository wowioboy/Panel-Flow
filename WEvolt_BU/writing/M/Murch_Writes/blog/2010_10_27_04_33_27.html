<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">I toyed with the idea of blogging regularly to accompany the entries, but frankly I'm at such a preliminary stage in how I want to present my work that there is rather little to say. &nbsp;So this one will stand for awhile as the general summary of what I am doing here on Murch Writes. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">For those of you who seem to have begun keeping up with me, thanks. &nbsp;If what I am offering up now is enough to keep your interest you should be very, very happy people once I properly figure out what I'm doing here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">I'm working on a few projects specifically for WeVolt right now. &nbsp;With that in mind as I write the pacing will match the update-schedule and the material is varied in mood, characters, and setting. &nbsp;So far, like the Age of Gods arc I began my WeVolt life with, its the best stuff I have yet written.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">For now, more of Jyk, and here is why. &nbsp;When I decided to jump into WeVolt, as suddenly as I made that leap, it was with a long term view in mind. &nbsp;Really, the concept for "Murch Writes" goes back quite a way. &nbsp;I even bought the domain and played around with HTML five or six years back, I just did not have the volume of material to take my shot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">The idea is to give a wider view of my writing than can show up in a novel. &nbsp;Tolkien had a big effect on my early on, but I was always more drawn to the Silmarillion and all of the behind the scenes worldbuilding stories that were compiled and published. &nbsp;That is probably because, even then, I was trying to turn daydreams into novels. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Even if I do not put it in print, I have always run through countless background stories in my head. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">I can't just sit down and list out the traits of races, nations, characters, etc - I write it out, developing everything organically. &nbsp;I create the framework in detail, then let my imagination run with it until something worthy of writing starts to coalesce.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">That's where all of this Jyk material really falls. &nbsp;It's a character study. &nbsp;An in depth examination of the mindset from which I will be approaching my first novel series. &nbsp;One version/viewpoint of the mindset, at least (Jyk is one of an ensemble cast of main characters). &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;"><em>The Scullion Warrior</em>, the novel that came out of this character study, also falls in that category, I have decided. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">So, here's the deal: if I am good enough gain a substantial readership on WeVolt over the next few months, I will run the novel here on a five or seven day a week schedule. &nbsp;This is a year of my labor I am talking about, here. &nbsp;The first novel I have successfully completed. &nbsp;A book &nbsp;for which the creation process was so intensive that the novel nearly buckled under the weight - I had to restructure the whole thing, rewrite half, and perform more revisions than I though possible. &nbsp;And I will be revising and polishing up until the day it goes live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">So if you have stumbled upon me, click the "read the latest page" pane at the top right and check it out. &nbsp;The best thing to do is click the &lt;&lt; button on the top left of the reader and check out the first story arc. &nbsp;I wrote it specifically to introduce my world to the internet and it serves that purpose far better than anticipated. &nbsp;If you like what you find, do me a favor and send a couple of friends my way. &nbsp;Maybe even throw up a comment, or click the 'like' button (heart) at the top and show me you're out there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">And keep an eye out over the next few weeks, I have some pretty radical ideas brewing. &nbsp;If I can pull even a couple of them off, this space should get extremely interesting with a quickness.</span></p>
