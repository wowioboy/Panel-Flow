<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay folks, this week we make a pretty drastic change from the Age of Gods story arc.  Today you meet Jyk Pevnal, the main character from the novel manuscript I cannot seem to stop referring to.   I have a number of other ideas that will be changing things up from time to time, but a collection of story arcs from early in his life are going to run over the next few months.   It will be around the time that I'm running out of that collection that I will decide what exactly is to be done with the manuscript itself.  (Maybe now I can stop bringing it up.)</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk lives in an epoch when the planar orbit has stretched the corporeal and celestial just about as far apart as they will go.  So, no magic/sorcery to speak of, little contact between races, vague religion for the most part.  Kind of like the Dark Ages without knights or an overpowering religious organization.  (Wednesday, I'll blog a more about the nature of the time and area of the continent we will be focusing on.)  Jyk is a young soldier in his duchy's professional army and something of a martial prodigy.  Ironically enough, we enter just as he is healing from taking a sword in the gut.</span></p>
