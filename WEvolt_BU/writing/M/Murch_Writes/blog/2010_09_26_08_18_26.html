Well, I figured that if I was going to throw up a placeholder here, it might as well be somewhat substantive.  It's called “Murch Writes” because it's not simply a novel which will be found here, but a collection of episodic works.  Most of what will be up first is extraneous (and non-spoiler) material from my first manuscript.  There will be more details on that novel in the fairly near future, so stay tuned.  I have a wealth of material waiting to be written just as quickly as I can get it typed, so I hope to keep a steadfast Monday, Wednesday, Friday update schedule here as well as continuing work on the other 4 novels in my first series.

October 4th, come back and meet Jyk Pevnal, the first character for whom I have completed a novel.
