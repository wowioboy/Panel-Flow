<span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Well, I know I said I was going to blog about the setting for this story arc today, but honestly most of it is irrelevant at this point. &nbsp;The basic thing is that Tarrant Duchy is a part of Tathren, one of many kingdoms inhabiting an where "empires" have not worked in quite some time, generally referred to as the "Midcountries". &nbsp;It's the middle bit of the Small Continent...sort of. &nbsp;At some point I'll make a digital version of my hand-drawn map and you can see what I mean. &nbsp;The one I have is definitely not worthy of scanning and showing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: small;">Other than that, not really much to blog about. &nbsp;As nerve wracking as putting my work out there can be, it's going to be a slow process gaining readers. &nbsp;If you have started keeping up with me and you like what you are getting so far, make your presence known. &nbsp;Click the heart (like) above the reader page or pop off with a comment down below it. &nbsp;I will have entries up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday without fail. &nbsp;If all this is going well after a few months I will see what I can do about pushing it to daily.</span></p>
