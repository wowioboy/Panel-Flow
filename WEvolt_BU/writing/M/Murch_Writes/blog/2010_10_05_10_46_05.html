<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well alright then, second update and all is well.  Kinks worked out, colors changed, calendar appendix added.  I even got my final revisions done early enough to pen a properly thoughtful blog entry.  Please bear with me while I continue sporadically fiddling with the settings, these meager html skills of mine are mighty rusty.  Even with how easy the WeVolt CMS makes things, it's gonna take some time before I'm happy with how everything looks around here.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">I guess I will take today's blog opportunity to explain a bit about what I hope to get (and give) out of WeVolt.  I made mention on Monday about a finished novel (awaiting a final set of intensive revisions, really) and another four to follow in my first series.  WeVolt is the lynchpin in my attempt to take advantage of the novel publishing industry's mishandling of the &ldquo;digital revolution&rdquo;.  What I do here will go hand in hand with my slow-developing plans for e-novel sales.  If you guys like the stuff I'm bringing enough to spread the word far and wide, $3 novels might just fall from the internet like digital rain.  In addition to my WeVolt projects, of course.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">That's not to say that what I post here will be secondary material.  To address one particular plot point, it is all &ldquo;canon&rdquo; and it is all in the same setting as the novels to come.  A couple of years ago I stopped repeatedly trying to start the same &ldquo;epic&rdquo; trilogy and focused my efforts on shorter things for the Writers of the Future contest.  Everything blew up to novella size no matter how hard I tried to keep the story length down.  Next thing I knew I had five novels sketched out in front of me, just waiting to be given the proper attention.  It is a &ldquo;series&rdquo;, but not in the essence that one plot takes five books to write.  Five individual plots tethered together by themes, characters, etc.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">What I also had was a head full of old story ideas clamoring for conversion into the setting I have created for the first series and beyond.  And that is what this mythological story arc is all about.  It occurred to me months and months ago when I was far too busy writing my first novel.  It simply had no purpose for being written until it sprang to mind last Thursday, then it seemed perfect.  You are going to get varied subjects, moods, themes, characters, races, even planes of existence.  Faerie tales, revenge stories, funny stories, sad stories, disturbing stories, love stories, maybe even some of that trendy bro-mance stuff.  Hell folks, even I don't know what I'm going to write next.  Keep it locked!</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">P.S.  I meant to mention it Monday, but all the &ldquo;old tongue&rdquo; type stuff that pops up is not just made up words.  It's  Scottish Gaelic (Gaidhlig), courtesy of the dictionary at </span><a href="http://www.clanmacrae.org/documents/gaelic.htm"><span style="font-size: small;">http://www.clanmacrae.org/documents/gaelic.htm</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;I'm trying to learn as much as I can as I move along with the novels, but mostly I am just pulling what I need when I need it.
