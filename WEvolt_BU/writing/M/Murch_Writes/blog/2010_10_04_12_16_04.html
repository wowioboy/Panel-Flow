Well, hello there WeVolt.  I'm Murch.  This is Murch Writes.  Riveted already, aren't you?  Well, this was going to be a long an informative blog, but on Thursday I decided that there was far too much epic flying around the site this week for me to start out with my initial choice.  So, the core of what will be going down in this space get exemplified right off the bat.  I have one novel finished, more details on that to come in the near future, the sequel a third of the way written and a veritable shit-ton of extra material bursting from my ears.</p>
<p>So, what I'll be putting up here is a collection of episodic works set in the same universe as my impending novel series.  It should be the perfect outlet for me to change up mood, theme, and just the general everything of what I am working on in the novels.  And so, late last week, I was reminded of a mythological idea I wanted to explore.  So, instead of introducing you to Jyk Pevnal, the main character around which that novel-for-which-I-have-few-details is centered, I will introduce you to the structure of this fantasy setting on the whole.  It is pretty different from what I normally do, especially the novels, but the more I revised it the more I liked it.  Hopefully you agree.</p>
<p>I'll be cleaning and changing the site up a bit as I go along, there's a disgustingly thick layer of rust on my html skills so it might be some time until I get things looking how I want.    Wednesday I hopefully will not be revising hours past my bedtime and should be able to offer a more thought out and personal blog entry.&nbsp;</p>
