<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">Today we, in some ways, reset the clock for Jyk. &nbsp;This arc is a little over a cycle(year) from the previous, although that interim encapsulates the period of time in which he matures far beyond the chronology. &nbsp;A "defining year," perhaps. &nbsp;This is at the beginning of that process. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">When you met Jyk, he was a promising young soldier. &nbsp;Here he is still the lowest of servants in Tarrant Castle. &nbsp;I have not referenced it much (most of that material is in the novel manuscript), but Jyk is orphan to a pair of castle servants. &nbsp;As such he was raised by castle servants and given the stature of their own scullion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="\"><span style="\"><span style="font-size: small;">Recently Jyk had been too happy to get into trouble - first love and all that - but now we find him fresh off of the inevitable heartbreak. &nbsp;After a bad moment cost him a few lashes, he decided to seek a more organized and fruitful place to vent his anger and frustration - prize fighting.</span></span></span></p>
