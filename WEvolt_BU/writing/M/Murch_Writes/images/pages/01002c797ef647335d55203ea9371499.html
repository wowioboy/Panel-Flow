There exists in this world </span><em><span style="font-size: medium;">The Book,</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> a tome older than any material has a right to be, and inside this Book lies the Truth of Reality.  I speak neither of a great work of mathematics, nor philosophy, nor even of sorcery.  Nay, it is a chronicle of history penned in a time when the gods themselves walked among us.  The few who know of The Book's existence believe to their &ndash; our &ndash; very core that it was written by one of those very same gods &ndash; or celestials, as they called themselves.  I have translated what I was able during my short time with it.  The only significant deed of my life lies in the few pages which follow.</span></span></span></p>
