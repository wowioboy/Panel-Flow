<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">It was a full span before Jyk got back on his feet, each day spent trying to learn something new about Evelyn.  Her parents had both served Baron Donivin, her mother running the kitchen and her father the castle steward.  Her mother passed away soon after Evelyn's tenth birthday, her father following four cycles hence, and the baron had welcomed her into his household with open arms.  Lady Lillian, she often professed, was the sweetest young noble anyone could hope to work for.  Most importantly, by the day Evelyn went back to work he was certain she liked him at least half as much as he did her.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">On his first night out of the castle since taking his wound she continued to dominate his thoughts, much to Kinzi's vociferous chagrin.  The Dog's Bollocks was packed, the minstrel singing was fantastic, and Jyk had been going on about the woman for over an hour.  &ldquo;Gods above, Jyk, get ahold of yourself.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk looked down at his mug, pouting.  &ldquo;Spend a span in the same room with the woman of your dreams and see if you don't talk about it too much.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi scoffed loudly.  &ldquo;Woman of your dreams?  Boy, that span you spent with her nursing you back to health is the entirety of the time you've known each other.  I agree, she's pretty, smart, and seems interesting, but you need to take a step back.  You barely know each other.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk scoffed in return.  &ldquo;This coming from the man that won't tell his best friend his first name.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi frowned deeply.  &ldquo;That's different.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk barked a laugh.  &ldquo;That's hypocrisy.  I'm supposed to listen to your advice about falling head over heels for a girl when you don't even trust me with your given name.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi's frown deepened as he took a long drink from his mug.  &ldquo;It really bothers you, does it?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">It just strikes me as odd that you trust me with your life, but not your bloody name.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi sighed heavily.  &ldquo;You can't tell anyone.&rdquo;  His eyes narrowed sharply.  &ldquo;Especially Torrvold.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk furrowed his brow, but nodded.  &ldquo;Right, right.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi cleared his throat softly.  &ldquo;Mervin.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk burst into loud laughter.  &ldquo;No, really, what is it?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi fixed his friend with a hard stare until the laughter subsided.  &ldquo;Mervin Bearlish Kinzington.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk managed to contain himself into a few short snickers.  &ldquo;Okay, okay.  I get it now.  Mervin.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi raised a finger sharply.  &ldquo;Never say that again.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk barked a short laugh.  &ldquo;Fine, fine.  But, Bearlish?  What in seven hells were your parents thinking?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi heaved a shrug.  &ldquo;Supposed to be a great-grandfather's name from each side of the family.  One Mervin, one Bearlish.  All shitty.&rdquo;  He barked a bitter laugh and quaffed the remaining beer in his mug.  &ldquo;Now, about the handmaiden.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk rolled his eyes, laughing and signaling Delk for another round.  &ldquo;What, damn it?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">I know you feel like the two of you grew close over the last span,&rdquo; said Kinzi, &ldquo;but stop to think about it for a minute.  Is it really a good idea to get romantic with someone you'll be working with </span><em><span style="font-size: small;">every day</span></em><span style="font-size: small;">?  I also hear-tell that Baron Donivin thinks of her like a daughter.  If you two hook up and things go bad...,&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">What, she'll turn vindictive and sabotage my career?&rdquo;  Jyk scoffed loudly.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">I'm just saying it's a bad idea,&rdquo; retorted Kinzi.  &ldquo;Tell him Delk.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk raised his eyebrows as he slid their mugs across the bar.  &ldquo;Tell who what now?,&rdquo; the balding tavern owner asked with a genial smile.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">That wooing the handmaiden to the girl he's gonna be guarding daily isn't smart,&rdquo; Kinzi answered.  &ldquo;Especially when she's a favorite of the baron.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk pursed his lips and furrowed his brow.  &ldquo;It does sound precarious,&rdquo; he said slowly.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk scoffed again.  &ldquo;Oh, come on.  Kinzi, did we not talk about exactly this sort of thing?  How awesome it was going to be, being surrounded by pretty handmaidens?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi sighed heavily.  &ldquo;Yeah, loose, easygoing handmaidens for us to have some occasional fun with.  Handmaidens that would only be in the castle for a couple span every cycle.  I don't recall either of us mentioning falling in love with a long term colleague.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Love?,&rdquo; asked Delk, somewhat incredulous.  &ldquo;Didn't you only wake up a span ago?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">My point exactly,&rdquo; Kinzi affirmed emphatically.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk rolled his eyes.  &ldquo;For the record, I haven't said a godsdamn thing about 'love'.  Yeah, it's possible that I could fall in love with her one day, but how in seven hells is that a bad thing?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk sighed heavily.  &ldquo;How did it feel when you watched Sara singing, every man in the audience undressing her with his eyes?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk scowled.  &ldquo;I wanted to burn them out of their skulls, of course, but that came along with her job.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk shook his head slowly from side to side.  &ldquo;No, that came with her being beautiful.  Her job just allowed for extra opportunitites.  Imagine watching every lordling Lady Lillian has contact with staring your darling up and down.  Blatantly, no doubt, as nobility doesn't need to disguise their lust.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi leaned in close beside Jyk.  &ldquo;And what if, one day, one of those lordlings makes a pass at her?  What if she accepted?  How would you react then?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk growled low in his throat.  &ldquo;What if Tarranton breaks out into mass rioting tonight?  Or hail starts falling on a hot summer's night?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">It's always dangerous to mix romance with work,&rdquo; Delk stated firmly.  &ldquo;That's all we are saying.  The more you care for the person, the more dangerous it gets.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk frowned down at his mug of fresh lager.  &ldquo;And if I already like her so much that I no longer want to visit Madame Raychelle's?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi's jaw went slack.  &ldquo;Have you even kissed her yet?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk shook his head sadly from side to side.  &ldquo;I'm bloody smitten and I can't seem to help myself.&rdquo;  He took a drink from his mug and sighed heavily.  &ldquo;I always thought the damsel was supposed to become instantly smitten with the hero, not vice versa.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk fixed Kinzi with a curious look.  &ldquo;Is she really that good looking?,&rdquo; he asked.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi thought for a moment before nodding.  &ldquo;She's gorgeous, I can't deny that.  A bit under five and a half feet, wavy auburn hair well past her shoulders, and &ndash; not that I was looking &ndash; quite a shapely figure.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk turned back to Jyk and sighed softly.  &ldquo;You've gone and got yourself in it all over again, haven't you?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk nodded dully.  &ldquo;It kind of blindsided me.  I mean, I knew she was extraordinary from the start, but...bugger it all, I didn't expect to feel like </span><em><span style="font-size: small;">this</span></em><span style="font-size: small;">.  I've been in a room with the woman for a solid span and all I can do is think about what to say the next time I see her.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Damn,&rdquo; said Kinzi, &ldquo;she's really got a hold on you, doesn't she?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk groaned lightly.  &ldquo;Delk, I'm gonna need whisky.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi clapped a hand on Jyk's shoulder as Delk nodded and went to retrieve a bottle.  &ldquo;I have to say, Jyk, I never figured you for such a sap,&rdquo; he said with a smile.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk barked a laugh.  &ldquo;With how much I've enjoyed Myla and Shyla's company, I didn't either.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk waved off the pleas of his busy bartender as he returned with a bottle and three glasses.  &ldquo;No matter how tough we like to think we are,&rdquo; he said as he filled the glasses, &ldquo;there's always a woman what can bring us to our knees.&rdquo;  He distributed the shot glasses among them.  &ldquo;To women.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">To women,&rdquo; repeated Jyk and Kinzi, drinking their shots.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, repressing your feelings certainly won't help things,&rdquo; said Delk, refilling the glasses, &ldquo;so I suppose the only thing to do is proceed.  With extreme caution.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk quirked an eyebrow as he picked up his freshly filled glass.  &ldquo;Caution, how?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk shrugged as he threw back a shot of whisky.  &ldquo;Move slowly, be sure not to offend her with your wooing, and if it does go badly do everything you can to keep her from hating you.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Hear hear,&rdquo; said Kinzi, downing the second shot.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk drank his and nodded slowly.  &ldquo;So, repressing my feelings bad, restraining them good.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Delk nodded with a bark of laughter.  &ldquo;Precisely.  Now, you two try not to get too hammered, I've gotta help the boy before he loses what little mind the gods gifted him with.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">So,&rdquo; chirruped Jyk, &ldquo;how's the training been going?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi scowled.  &ldquo;Bloody frustrating.  I can't think of anything more maddening than knowing exactly what you want your arm to do &ndash; and how to do it &ndash; and having it steadfastly refuse.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk frowned.  &ldquo;Who have you been working with?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi shrugged.  &ldquo;Mostly just whoever is around.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, that won't work,&rdquo; Jyk said sharply.  &ldquo;You need someone that can retrain you as if you're a novice fighter all over again.  We'll go talk to Master-at-arms Varlin in the morning.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi raised an eyebrow.  &ldquo;Master Varlin?  Really?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well yeah,&rdquo; Jyk said flatly.  &ldquo;He trained me, so why in seven hells wouldn't he want to help you get back into fighting form?  He can't very well let his best pupil march to war without his most trusted comrade, now can he?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think you're forgetting about Maess, aren't you?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk shrugged.  &ldquo;Maess is great, like family and all, but...well, where I think of you like a brother...he's more of a cousin.  I mean, yeah, I trust him with my life and all, but I would damn sure rather have my brother watching my back.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi grinned widely.  &ldquo;I was thinking the same thing, actually.  Maybe it has something to do with his being raised as a rich kid.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk thought a moment before nodding slowly.  &ldquo;Y'know, you're probably right.  I guess it's just harder to mesh with someone that doesn't share in having had a rough upbringing.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah,&rdquo; affirmed Kinzi, &ldquo;I relate to pretty much anyone who grew up kind of poor, from farmers to servants, but people with money...it's like they grew up in a totally different world.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">They do,&rdquo; said Jyk.  &ldquo;Different rules, different setting, different schooling &ndash; it provides a completely different perspective on things.  Although Maess doesn't seem to have the entitlement issues that most of them have, even with his father losing everything.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

The rich cousin whose side of the family fell back down to our level.&rdquo;  He flashed a toothy grin.  &ldquo;Speaking of our level, when do you go back to work?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk shrugged.  &ldquo;Two or three days.  The captain wants me to check in each afternoon so he can look me over, make me bend and flex without pain or opening my wound.  Until then Lady Lillian stays attached to her mother's side and under her detail's watch.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

I did hear the rat bastard recovered twice as fast as me, though.  Lucky prick.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kinzi nodded.  &ldquo;A couple inches in any direction and that thrust would have been fatal.  The son of a bitch nearly got everyone killed and will barely have a scar.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; text-decoration: none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jyk growled.  &ldquo;The healer said mine's gonna be prominent.  Apparently I did a lot of extra damage after it was wrapped up.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
