<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk woke in the back room of The Dog's Bollocks with pain both inside his head and spread over his face, but his smile remained.  When they had left the arena after his fight with Pyke, a fairly large group of spectators had followed them back to the pub and proceeded to have a raucous party in his honor.  It seemed that several of them had won quite a lot of money by betting on him and felt it was only right to get him good and drunk as their way of thanks.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The full light of day was streaming through the pub's windows as Jyk trudged into the main room and plopped himself down on a stool.  Delk was slowly wiping down the bar in anticipation of the day's business with a hefty smile of his own.  &ldquo;Quite a night for you, wasn't it?,&rdquo; he greeted cheerily, sliding a glass of a strange greenish liquid across the bar.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk looked at the glass curiously before responding.  &ldquo;I never knew violence could have so many benefits.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk chuckled softly.  &ldquo;For professionals, yes.  Now, drink that stuff, it'll take the edge off the hangover you most certainly have.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk quirked an eyebrow questioningly, but lifted the glass and downed the thick, grassy mixture it contained without voicing complaint.  &ldquo;Interesting...,&rdquo; he said with a sigh, thumping the empty glass down onto the bar.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk nodded.  &ldquo;It's full of all the stuff you're missing after a hard night's drinking.  So, what's your plan for the day?  Shopping spree?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk nodded.  &ldquo;Seems like the thing to do seeing as I have to go back to work tomorrow.  Probably pick up a liniment or something for my face while I'm at it.  May even be the first stop.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Just try not to get too carried away.  There's nothing to say that the coin will keep rolling in like this, y'know.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk rolled his eyes.  &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, but even losing fights pay well.  Besides, I'm gonna run out of things to buy rather quickly, I expect; I have few needs and little space at the castle.  I should probably buy Kayla something, shouldn't I?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk smiled warmly.  &ldquo;That'd be mighty thoughtful of you.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But...what would she want?  Does she like jewelry?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk shrugged.  &ldquo;No clue, but I do know that she sews her own clothes.  Why not buy her a roll of some good cloth or something?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk grinned widely.  &ldquo;That sounds pretty good, actually.&rdquo;  He stood up.  &ldquo;I guess I should go see...uh...what was the healer's name that you sent me to?  I guess I never caught it last time around.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Renna?  Yeah, she can set you up, but expect a a lecture.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk realized how right Delk had been from the moment he entered Renna's clinic.  She stomped out from behind her shop-counter armed with a glower and hip-holstered fists.  &ldquo;And just what in seven hells happened to <em>you</em>?  No pretty minstrel-girl to simper over you this time, eh?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk sighed heavily.  &ldquo;No, Sara left Tarranton awhile ago.  I got these in a very profitable and highly organized pit fight.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Renna scoffed loudly as she got right in his face to examine the swelling.  &ldquo;And just how much money did you make getting your face pulverized?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk smiled widely.  &ldquo;Well, considering how much more pulverizing I did than the other guy, I ended up making ten tala last night.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Renna took a couple of steps back, her scowl shrinking markedly.  &ldquo;Oh.  Well, that's a bit different, then.  What d'you want, something to take the swelling down and soothe the pain a bit?  I'll give you a little pot for ten bits that'll last many fights into the future.  Deal?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk quirked an eyebrow.  &ldquo;Ten bits?  You wouldn't try to take advantage of a young man just because he recently came into some money, would you?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Renna scowled.  &ldquo;Fine, five bits, though it's a real hassle breaking a whole tala for that little.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk's smile softened as he followed her to the counter and dug a tala from the coin pouch secured inside his waistband.  She took a small pot down from one of several shelves lining the wall behind her and set to counting out forty-five bits with a scowl on her face.  Jyk immediately began rubbing a thin layer of the liniment over his face, sighing softly at the sensation.  It was cool, almost as if there was a winter breeze blowing in his face, and the pressure from the swelling seemed to decrease instantly.  He thanked her profusely as he tied a string around the pot to hold the lid on and fastened one end of the string around his belt.  A proper set of belt pouches would have to be part of his clothing purchases.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Clothes were his next stop, as a matter of fact.  There was a very nice, inexpensive tailor's shop just around the corner from Renna's and it seemed the obvious place to go.  He walked out with a package containing several sets of shirts and pants, some in the colors of House Brantley, some not.  The finest of the blue and browns he wore out of the shop &ndash; along with a belt lined with a wide array of pouches.  It had cost an entire silver tala, but the way he saw it an entire wardrobe was easily worth ten percent of his earnings.  The tailor even pointed him in the direction of a cobbler with the same sort of high quality-low price approach to business.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">By the time he was finished hopping from store to store around the craftsman's district Jyk had added a pair of boots, a knife made just for woodcarving, the softest set of sheets he had ever felt, a feather pillow, and a bolt of blue rohirrish cotton for Kayla to his collection &ndash; along with a large duffel bag with which to carry everything.  The sun was almost ready to set by the time Jyk made it back to The Dog's Bollocks and the pub had just begun to fill.  He stowed his bag in the back room before bellying up to the bar and signaling Delk for a lager.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You look good,&rdquo; Delk said, sliding a full mug across the bar.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thank you.  I bought pretty much everything I could think of any only spent three and a half tala.&rdquo;  He sipped from his mug with a smile.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Not bad, but I'm guessing you didn't stuff a mattress into that bag.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk chuckled.  &ldquo;I'm gonna have to look into that one some other time.  Not really an item I can carry across town, no matter how awesome the boots I bought are.  And they are awesome.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk grinned happily.  &ldquo;That's great, kiddo.  When d'you plan on heading back to the castle?,&rdquo; he asked.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk shrugged.  &ldquo;I dunno, I figure I'll make the walk pretty late &ndash; it's not like I have anything to do up there other than sleep.  Besides, the longer I'm around the more questions I'll get about the bruises on my face.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk barked a laugh.  &ldquo;One night's not gonna change the bruises much, Jyk, nor is it gonna stop the questions about why you're wearing new clothes.  Hells, there might've been a couple castle folk at the fights last night.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk's eyes widened.  &ldquo;I...I don't know what I think about that...,&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk furrowed his brow.  &ldquo;What, you mean to tell me you didn't think anyone would find out about your prize fighting?  It's some of the cheapest entertainment in Tarranton.  There's fights every night of the span.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk heaved a sigh.  &ldquo;I guess I never really thought about it.  Will it be a good thing or a bad thing, do you think?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk quirked an eyebrow curiously.  &ldquo;I would think becoming known as a skilled professional fighter could be nothing <em>but</em> good.  Girls think it's sexy and guys think it's cool.  And who wants to start shit with a pro?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk nodded, convinced.  &ldquo;Well, I guess that makes sense.&rdquo;  He flashed a smile which quickly morphed into a small frown.  &ldquo;Money and success make people jealous, though.  Where you see admiration I see envy and resentment.  And being attacked in numbers.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk rolled his eyes.  &ldquo;Ever the bloody pessimist.  Not all swords are double-edged, Jyk.  Sometimes a good thing is just that:  a good thing.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk scoffed.  &ldquo;I'll believe that only once I experience it.  As far as I can tell everything good comes with a healthy dose of the bad.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Bah, you've just taken more than your fair share of shit so far in life.  It's gotta balance out sometime.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk fixed Delk with a doubtful expression.  &ldquo;I thought that once before, remember?  I'm not going to make the mistake of thinking one piece of life can make everything better &ndash; not again.  No matter how successful I am as a fighter I'll always be a speck of dirt inside the castle and that's just how it is.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk grumbled loudly.  &ldquo;Not if you push the advantage.  Didn't Howle tell you that Varlin might overlook your age if you show enough talent?  I'd say becoming a prize fighting champion before your sixteenth birthday takes a lot of bloody talent, wouldn't you?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk arched an eyebrow.  &ldquo;So I earn Varlin's favor by beating people senseless in exchange for money?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In a way,&rdquo; Delk said with a chuckle.  &ldquo;As Master-at-arms it's part of his job to be on the lookout for talent and you've managed to keep out of major trouble before &ndash; why not now?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk relented with a nod.  &ldquo;I guess you have a point, I'm just finding it hard to be motivated into good behavior.  I mean, before I was being good to earn time spent with Sara.  Now it's just to go get into a fight with an audience and a profit.  And I'm already pretty much out of stuff to buy.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk quirked an eyebrow.  &ldquo;Not exactly the perfect outlet for your frustrations you thought it would be?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk shrugged discontentedly.  &ldquo;Well, I managed to vent most of my misgivings about Sara leaving, but now I'm kind of stuck with the same anger I had before.  I mean, what's the point really?  Either way I fight for money and remain the duke's bitch-boy.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk raised his other eyebrow to join the first.  &ldquo;The glory of the day's shopping spree wearing off, I take it?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk sighed and took a long drink of lager.  &ldquo;When I first won the ten tala it seemed like it would make such a difference, but...well, nice clothes and comfortable boots may make a guy feel pretty good but it doesn't actually <span style="font-style: normal;">change</span> a damn thing.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk frowned sympathetically.  &ldquo;Being cheered on in the pit and celebrated after the fight not fulfilling for you?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Jyk shrugged again.  &ldquo;Don't get me wrong, it feels great to have so many people behind me.  But if I lose a fight, will they care?  They don't have any real interest in me, I just put on an exciting show.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Wow,&rdquo; Delk said incredulously, &ldquo;most guys your age would kill for that sort of popularity.  I figured after spending so much of your life at the bottom of the barrel you'd appreciate it doubly so.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;">&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sure, having people like and admire me is nice, but in all honesty I find it rather pointless.  Great fighter or not, well-known or not, I'm still the servants' scullion.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 0.3in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Delk growled with irritation.  &ldquo;Then put your mind to joining the bloody Guard and quit grousing about the 'point' of it all.  Yeah, as a member of the Ducal Guard you take orders from the duke, but that life is a damn sight better than scrubbing pots.  Want to feel more like your own man?  Work your ass off and climb the rankings of the guard &ndash; anyone can rise to become a commissioned officer and <em>that</em> makes you a landed noble.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
