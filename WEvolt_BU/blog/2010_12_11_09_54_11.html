I was really pleased to find that I still owned darkfell.com after all these years, so today I pointed the URL to this account. Little by little, I'm continuing to work out more story details, including more of Gladden's backstory, and character design for the following individuals:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arrikhan d'Goshen - Gladden's half brother, Arrikhan is a noted (and feared) Combat Thaumaturge, said to have been the deciding factor in the Battle of the Glass Hills. Often considered to be one of the 'Character Assassins,' Arrikhan is a solitary, brooding individual who is at times consumed with a rage whose origin is unknown. The son of an elf and a giant Matriarch, Arrikhan is nearly 9 feet tall and possesses exceptional combat skill.</p>
<p>Katarina The Dragon Slayer - a half-elf, Katarina is the first female to attain the status of Pelethite Champion. One of the now legendary 'Character Assassins,' she played a major role in the Integrity War and possesses a pair of shortswords reputed to have been blessed by one of the Elder Magisters.</p>
<p>Moab - Perhaps the most feared assassin of the last 500 years, Moab  gathered a group of outlaws and one paladin, dubbed the 'Character  Assassins' by Arrikhan, and with them began a series of intrigues,  raids, and assassinations which led to the Intregrity War, which  restored control of the Melloren Essora to the Forest Elves and united  the three Elven Kingdoms under the Obsidian Throne for the first time in  more than 3000 years. Now reigning as the High Lord of the Elven  Kingdoms, Moab has little time and more than a little distate for the  notion of adventure, but must decide whether or not to intervene in the  Uncovering of the Fetters.</p>
<p>Taloy Minkh - A mysterious human claiming to have come from another world, Taloy came to Melloren to study the ancient ruins of the Stone Prophecy Dynasty and stumbled upon an artufact known as a <em>ryischia</em>, a sentient metalloid contained within a disc-shaped amulet. The <em>ryischia</em> bonded itself to Taloy and transformed him into one of the living machines of war used by the Arrenor. Generally active as a mercenary Taloy has no allegiances beyond his next contract.</p>
<p>Witherspore - one of the few humans allowed to live in the forest of the Melloren Essora, she was trained by the famed artificer, Calandryll, and continues to design weaponry and equipment for the Eastern Settlments. A devout follower of the Moonlit Path, she disavows any involvement with the Character Assassins, but is reported to have crafted Gladden Darkfell's armor from the scales of the dragon Torg.</p>
<p>Emperor Pelagius XVI - Ruler of the deteriorating Harkad Empire, Pelagius struggles to keep the empire from falling into anarchy. His tenuous hold has largely depended upon the use of Stone Prophecy artifacts and it is rumored that he has become a student of the dark arts in his search for the power. Despite his failing rule, Pelagius is still determined to attempt the conquest of tthe Melloren Essora.</p>
<p>That's all for now :)</p>
