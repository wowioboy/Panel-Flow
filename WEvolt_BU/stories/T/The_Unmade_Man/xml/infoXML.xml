Mohler</colorist><synopsis>For Boruin, the past is simply dark. There is a ribbon of runes that turns across his body. He cannot read them, but they hold strange magics, too dangerous to use unknown. There is nothing in his mind before waking on the Nefazo Trade Highway thirty years past.The woman standing above him on the deserted road offers her own mysteries. Wraethe is moon-driven, awake under Diun’s shine and dead to the world during the day. Her temper and lust for blood often places her near the edge of chaos and mindless rage. Though a killer by trade, there is still heat in Wraethe\'s heart, no matter how deeply hidden.A Mana’Olai assassin and short grave robber complete the small band that works across the jungle borders of Nefazo. Sometime thieves, bodyguards, strong-arms, diplomats, the crew honors what contracts pay. Boruin’s band has done well–until they meet the child.The acquisition of the boy has turned Boruin back to his long unanswered questions. The quiet boy’s eyes are sharp, seeing the shifting tattoos where others see nothing. His touch turns them down Boruin’s arms and brings the spells to life. Where is this boy from? Who contracted Boruin to bring him out of the deep jungle? Why does he seem to know so much about that which is hidden?All other obligations are disregarded as Boruin turns back to his past. Contracts are broken, friendships are pulled apart, and lives are lost to discover the man that was once unmade</synopsis><letterist></letterist><tags></tags><genre></genre><headerimage></headerimage><copyright></copyright></info></comic>
