<p>Boruin wavered, still feeling the rocking of the hill even as he watched it drift back south into the jungle. He had saved his breakfast, which was a better result than what would&rsquo;ve happened if they had actually been aboard a ship.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Damn Fae,&rdquo; he cursed again, though he could not deny that his crew had gotten the better out of their deal. It had taken weeks of searching the jungle before they found the boy. It would have taken two more to make it back out, save for the bumbling little creature piloting that hill. The Fae had cut straight cross-country, though at times tipping over the steepest cliffs and climbing up the highest peaks. It was a path Boruin did not wish to take twice, even if they had made it in a day. Beyond that, he was looking forward to Wraethe&rsquo;s waking remarks. She would, of course, deride his decision and method of dealing with the Fae, but she could not dismiss the results.<br /> <br /> They set to trekking down the western shoulder of the mountain, the ridges below them spreading and splitting until they formed three separate hands pointing out from the large peak. At one time, it might have been the Mountain of the Four Hands, but the northern side of the peak had sheared off long ago. The locals claimed that the mah&rsquo;saiid had carved a massive city into that fourth ridge. The drunken ones would whisper low over the table that it had been the capital of the ancient civilization. The Purahd, that unknown plague that 3000 years past had torn body and soul out of the mah&rsquo;saiid and the land they lived on, had not taken the city. Instead, rumor said that it was moved when the Nefazo crossed south over the Monahdriachean Range. It was all ale-soaked nonsense to Boruin. Perhaps it had been there, perhaps the Purahd had taken it, but the city sure hadn&rsquo;t up and moved, no matter how powerful the mah&rsquo;saiid were. To the locals, though, every twisted tree, box canyon, and unexplainable cosmic event had something to do with mah&rsquo;saiid secrets.<br /> <br /> They moved down off the mountain, Pile leading them through game trails and forgotten paths. Few would expect a tired and worn group to come out of the jungle, climbing up the mountain just to walk back down, but Boruin was careful. They avoided the main roads and stepped down the ridge without incident.<br /> <br /> Boruin spat, almost at the same time as Toaaho, as the jungle cleared and the city became visible below. The heart of Terre Haute had the makings of a beautiful town. Resting on the upper slope between two of the main ridgelines, the old settlement sat above the swamp where the breeze washed away the smell of wet decay and the hungry midges.<br /> <br /> The North Quarter was one of the birthmarks of the Nefazo nation. Those old stone buildings, with their squat towers and wide arches, bore the look of distant northern cities. Their builders had been the first families of the great caravan sent south by the high merchant houses of northern civilizations. Two hundred years prior they&rsquo;d traveled south, seeking a trade route through the wild center of the continent. Those that survived refused to risk the death that would come of returning. Instead they carved out a new country in the jungles and lowlands of the south.<br /> <br /> The Nefazo nation was born of merchants weighing chance against risk. Modern Nefazo continued in the same vein. The merchants were generally a lot fatter than their ancestors, and the chances they weighed were of sly sales and trades rather than survival in a wilderness. Regardless, all Nefazo were merchants right through to the juice of their bones. That was one trait never been bred out of the Nefazo. They worshiped the art of the trade, and its laws, the L&rsquo;Traie nu Duoit, were their scripture.<br /> <br /> Terre Haute crumbled into ruin as the nation expanded toward the southern coast and the trade routes found through the sea. When the mah&rsquo;saiid ruin of Trilaeta was found three-weeks hard journey northeast, eyes turned again to the northern borders. The mah&rsquo;saiid had long ago withdrawn from the world, their civilization dwindling down to nothing, but their ruins remained. An ache for artifacts from that mysterious race had long infected the modern Nefazo like a slow fever. The city returned to life and growth, but it took on a new character.<br /> <br /> Down the slopes below the North Quarter, new merchants built their quarters. They flocked from Ouilainne to buy cheap from those foolish enough to enter the jungles and sell the newfound treasures back to the capital. Between them and the swamp, ramshackle inns and cane and leaf huts were tacked together to house those fevered relic hunters. These ill moved north with their eyes set on wealth lying hidden under the blanket of jungle growth. Illusions of gems nestled among the river stones and vaults of gold under each northern hill swam through their minds. Some returned south with the treasures and stories for which they came. Most entered the jungle and stayed there, rotting in the swamps under blood-letting plants or in the bellies of hungry creatures.<br /> <br /> Worse were the seekers of darker items. Crossbreeds of magic and metal would purchase entire kingdoms. Unlike the stories of unlimited gold and silver, these artifacts were more than just rumors. Too many had been found to deny their existence. Most were carried out of the jungle in disrepair, sitting too long under the humid press of mist and mold. A precious few survived intact, their metal untarnished, their workings unmolested by time. Their workings were often as mysterious as their purpose: devices that changed river mud into chalky stone, drove veins of metal into wood, thickened water until it sat like a ball inside it&rsquo;s bowl. Some just killed, and others just healed and often neither were precise. Rarely were these carried out of the jungle without a dark smear of new blood staining them, a sign of a double cross, an ambush, or an amateur hand too eager to explore its operations.<br /> <br /> The buyers of such things were cautious ones. They bartered for men unknown and carefully hidden. It was these rich proxies that now inhabited the North Quarter. Belok had taken a shop on the outskirts, though he could only wish for the influence and wealth of these elite merchants. It was for them that Boruin&rsquo;s spit had left its mark in the dirt. If anything had caused the legendary Purahd, Boruin guessed it had been machines like the ones they sought. If any man was further removed from the proud merchants that had conquered the continent by crossing it, it was a merchant willing to pay any price, in gold or blood, for those vile machines.<br /> <br /> Yet, Terra Haute was home. It was no great city, but neither was Terra Haute a backwater slum. It was a mix between, like the prospectors and relic hunters, whores and reputable merchants that all shared shoulder space between the middle and western hands of the mountain. And where there is wealth, or imagined wealth, there is thievery.<br /> <br /> Boruin had caught Pile&rsquo;s hands in his pocket here, a skinny boy hardly older than nine years that could turn sideways and almost slip between a door and its jam. He&rsquo;d put the kid to work for one week as punishment, and Pile liked to joke that the week was now 15 years long.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Watch for them,&rdquo; Boruin whispered as they stepped onto the city bridge that stretched over the mountain stream and into the small clothing market on the west side of North Quarter. A boy lifted his eyes from his small blanket of wares and watched them cross. He grabbed the corners, threw the load over his shoulders, and peddled off through the crowd.<br /> <br /> Pile chewed on his thumb to cover the movements of his lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Two more,&rdquo; Toaaho added.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;The one in the swamp waders?&rdquo; Pile asked.<br /> <br /> Toaaho stooped to pluck a stone out of his boot and, with his back to the market, thumbed toward a stall covered in stacks of brightly colored bolts of silk. &ldquo;Yes, and the one in the red trousers,&rdquo; he replied.<br /> <br /> Boruin saw another man look up from his drink, his ornate earrings sparkling brightly across the fine weave of his robe. The merchant tipped back the mug and left the patio for a refill at the bar. Boruin knew they&rsquo;d been marked. No rich merchant gets his own drinks. He&rsquo;d look too eager and unable to barter for a lower price. &nbsp;He memorized the man&rsquo;s high sideburns, &nbsp;light scar near the hairline, and long stride before turning back to his crew.<br /> <br /> Boruin gathered them in a close circle. &ldquo;At least four. Our contract may have gathered an interest,&rdquo; Boruin said. &ldquo;Pile, start your drinking. Find out who&rsquo;s looking, which ones were looking for us, and which were just the regular purse cutters.&rdquo; Pile smiled too broadly, and Boruin reminded him to listen first and drink second. &ldquo;Toaaho, check the hotels and the gaming houses. See who&rsquo;s in town.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;What about the boy?&rdquo; Toaaho asked.<br /> <br /> Boruin looked to the sun. It wasn&rsquo;t as low as he&rsquo;d like, but dusk was close. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite capable, and Wraethe will be up soon. I&rsquo;ll make the evening&rsquo;s arrangements. You know where. I expect you back at a decent hour.&rdquo; Boruin faced Pile for that last statement. The short man winked and bounded off with his hand already in his coin purse.<br /> <br /> Toaaho tightened his black silk scarf to keep the wind from pulling it free from his face. There were plenty other slave tattoo masks in Nefazo, but Boruin didn&rsquo;t chide the man for his need of secrecy. He knew well enough when to leave a man alone.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Here, boy. Come on, now,&rdquo; Boruin called, trying to command the child away from a horse trough. The boy continued to scoop the water up and hold his cupped hands under the horses&rsquo; noses. Boruin slid between the drinking beasts and bent to the boy.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;There will be plenty of time to play,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there are times when we must be serious. I&rsquo;ll need you to listen closely and act quickly. Can you do that?&rdquo; The boy looked hard into the man&rsquo;s eyes, as if deciding. He wiped his wet palms on Boruin&rsquo;s vest, leaving a stained print, and wrapped his fingers around the man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;ll have to be&ndash;but the left hand, son.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Boruin led with his right thumb resting in his belt, close to his sword&rsquo;s hilt. Wraethe walked just behind and beside the boy. Her stride was long and smooth, and she seemed to glide over the cobbled street. Those that recognized the dark shade stepped lightly out of her way. He hoped her senses were near the surface of her sleep now that the sun was dipping close to the horizon. Walking into town with a contract completed was not the time to let your guard down. More than once, a crew had been waylaid just as they returned for their pay. Disreputable merchants would leak their contracts and pay a street thug half of the amount they&rsquo;d offered the relic hunters. Thieves in the home stretch were almost more dangerous than the creatures abroad.<br /> <br /> Belok was not one to be trusted. Boruin had no love for the man and that certainly went both ways. The skinny bastard always tried to renegotiate after completion, but he had yet to seriously cross Boruin. Belok knew that the old man could handle any job faster and more discretely than most. The merchant had promised to pay dearly for this one, but not what it was truly worth, not by far if Pile&rsquo;s theories were right. Boruin wondered if he knew whom he had sent them for.<br /> <br /> Boruin moved quickly through the streets, sticking to the shaded side of the avenues in hope that Wraethe could come forward sooner. He watched every passing face, marking any that gave him consideration. He moved fast but not so quickly as to draw extra attention. He relaxed, and his breath deepened as he reached Simonez&rsquo;s curio shop. They would be safe for the night, at least.<br /> <br /></p>

<p><br />&ldquo;Baelly&rsquo;o, here&rsquo;s your man, back aga&rsquo;n!&rdquo; Pile slurred as he waltzed into his third bar. His rowdy hair was smoothed down to one side, probably with some of the ale that had drenched the front of his red vest. The keep looked up with half a wince and half a smile as Pile plopped himself down on the nearest stool. It was the kindest response the short man had received all afternoon, though he knew Baelly liked him less than most.<br /><br />&ldquo;Back from the graves, me boy&rsquo;o?&rdquo; the bartender asked.<br /><br />Pile placed both hands on the bar and carefully climbed up on top the stool. &ldquo;Aye, and your coldest mug from the coldest tap would just quench my thirst,&rdquo; the young man answered.<br /><br />Baelly made no move to serve him. &ldquo;Not a chance sonny, I got no help today, and I ain&rsquo;t climbin&rsquo; down the cellar stairs with hands such as your&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Fair enough. Then I&rsquo;ll take whatever warm, swamp-stale pot of piss I can afford,&rdquo; Pile said.<br /><br />Baelly pulled out a mug and poured a deep red draught from his tarnished pitcher. He held the mug just behind the bar as Pile wet his lips and reached out with two hands for the drink. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the key, ain&rsquo;t it? What you can afford.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was Pile&rsquo;s turn to wince, but he followed through with a flip of his thumb and a silver coin spinning on the bar top. &ldquo;One for yourself out of that,&rdquo; Pile said as he took a long swig of the hard ale. &ldquo;I need more than just your drink today,&rdquo; he added.<br /><br />&ldquo;Never known anyone that comes only for that,&rdquo; Baelly answered.<br /><br />&ldquo;Right you are, and so then: any word on me and my crew?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You mean the ghost and her crew?&rdquo; Baelly asked.<br /><br />Pile leaned back, ignoring the insult. His hands snapped to the edge of the bar as he remembered at the last moment there was not back to the stool. &ldquo;Well, call it what you must.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard nothing in terms of your work, but that gentleman&rsquo;s been all over town asking if you&rsquo;ve come in,&rdquo; Baelly said with a wide grin and a nod over Pile&rsquo;s shoulder.<br /><br />Pile turned to follow the bartender&rsquo;s glance and saw five fingers plowing him out of his seat. The short man sat up and shook his head, his eyes clearing to see a man bowing his head just to fit under the rafters.<br /><br />&ldquo;Mother had a giant fetish, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Pile coughed as the enormous man picked him up and slung him back the other direction. The man ground his teeth and held his tongue, but drove down with his heavy boot to crush Pile in the ribs. The thin relic hunter rolled under the man&rsquo;s wide stance and sliced out with his knife. The sharp edge bit above the hard leather of his opponent&rsquo;s boot and split a chunk of meat across his huge calf. The man roared and pinched his feet together, but Pile was already moving. The unexpected punch had knocked the afternoon&rsquo;s drunk right out of him, and he was ready now.<br /><br />&ldquo;All right, tall and dim, you want to start this over?&rdquo; Pile asked, his short axe swinging lightly in his hand.<br /><br /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*****</div>
<p><br />Splitting up hadn&rsquo;t done them any good. The four that scrambled to pass word of their arrival weren&rsquo;t just on the lookout for any returning contractors. The people now following Toaaho were very professional. They worked as a team, taking turns tailing him every few blocks in the hopes they&rsquo;d go unnoticed. Toaaho hoped the others were facing better odds.<br /><br />A thin alley appeared as he passed the next merchant&rsquo;s cart, and Toaaho ducked inside. The walls tapered closer, and the Mana&rsquo;Olai pressed himself against either side, climbing quickly between the small, squat houses surrounding the square. He vaulted over the short mud wall around the roof and landed motionless, one leg passed through the ties of a hammock. The man stretched out in his nap did not move as Toaaho silently stepped around him.<br /><br />The three men who had been following him were still in the plaza, idling between the carts, looking across the merchandise and around at the crowd. They converged slowly at the head of the alley and whispered through their thick veils before separating once more. Toaaho watched them mingle again, deciding which to follow. As he rose to trail his target, the sharp whistle of a feathered shaft slicing through the still air caused him to throw his body back, leaving him leaning dangerously far over the edge of the building. His foot hooked into the base of the small mud wall and held him as the arrow passed just across his chest. He rolled to the side and watched the round clay tip burst. Its contents swirled in dark blue vapors across the sleeping man.<br /><br />Toaaho held his breath and lunged into the cloud, grabbing the edge of the hammock. He felt his skin start to numb as he dumped the sleeper uncaringly out of the net and down the hatch that lead into the house below. He heard the man hit the floor with a thump, but it couldn&rsquo;t hurt more than the gas had it gotten into the man&rsquo;s lungs and blood.<br /><br />His knife sang as it deflected the second arrow, this one tipped with iron and ready to kill. The third flashed in the setting sun, dropping down from a high tower across the plaza. It buried deep into the mud wall where Toaaho had been just moments before he&rsquo;d dropped to the street.<br /><br />The Mana&rsquo;Olai ran down the alley, holding his breath until his lungs burned like white embers. The vapors released by the exploding arrow would cling to fabric, though such a small amount would not knock him unconscious. He could not afford his mind to slow; his tingling hands would be problem enough.<br /><br />The alley opened into a cool garden backing the small houses built flush against the surrounding streets. Toaaho did not break stride, hearing more footsteps than his own echoing between the mud walls. He tore into the next alley, continuing even as a dark silhouette raced toward him with a silver blade extended. The two closed fast, and Toaaho did not change his pace until he saw the man would not feint, but drive him through.<br /><br />The Mana&rsquo;Olai vaulted again, cartwheeling above his attacker. His short knife parried the blade down as he bit into the walls with his knee and shoulder, bracing tight. He hung there for a moment, his knife drawing blood under the man&rsquo;s neck as his other hand ripped the cloth from his attacker&rsquo;s head.<br /><br />Toaaho searched the face, ignoring the fear and the sudden surprise that always comes before death. A quick glance was enough to confirm this man did not know who he was after, not truly. The men that would come for Toaaho, son of Anitelu, would come prepared to die, as the K&ouml;peka did not die well.<br /><br />Two hands grabbed him from above and Toaaho was flung back toward the garden. He fell hard, and the man charged again, but the Mana&rsquo;Olai was already rolling to his feet and back out of the alley. The two men above dropped from the roof, and he could feel others filing in from the other streets. He pulled free his robe, his fingers still numb but able to hear them tap at the blades in his belt.<br /><br /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*****</div>
<p><br />The assassin&rsquo;s dart passed through Wraethe before it struck the door of Simonez&rsquo;s shop, Boruin was sure of it. He could still see the thin hole and the loose thread torn from the fabric of her cloak. He pulled the boy behind him as a second and third were thrown through the woman&rsquo;s body. They stuck shivering beside the first in Simonez&rsquo;s door.<br />Boruin looked for a seizure of pain, the hurt of the needle-sharp metal puncturing her body. He saw instead her eyes appear, the blue coming forward like a down rushing storm.<br /><br />If they had thought to catch Wraethe asleep, they&rsquo;d come too close to Diuntyne&rsquo;s dawn. The sun still covered the threshold of the shop, but Wraethe woke all the same. Her robe swirled about her like overlapping shadows, and Boruin heard the twang of her bow from somewhere beneath. The assassin doubled over and then whipped back as the first shaft caught him in the gut and the second through the skull.<br /><br />&ldquo;Inside,&rdquo; Wraethe commanded with a whisper, rationing her strength. Boruin threw his shoulder against the wooden door and pushed the wide-eyed boy into the shop. He turned and guarded the opening as they came for her.<br /><br />A second man stepped out of the thinning crowd, thrusting his knife from behind. The blade passed in and out of the darkness of Wraethe&rsquo;s robe. He slashed across, cutting only fabric as the iron tip of an arrow stabbed out of the shadows to pierce his throat. She let him fall and stepped back into the deepening shade of the building as if the dimming light smothered her and the growing darkness were air she could breathe. Archers let fly from the rooftops, and she held her ground as the shafts broke on the hard brick behind her. She slung her own upward, the feathers screaming their high-pitched whistle until throttled out by their smash into meat.<br /><br />The street emptied quickly. Citizens disappeared around corners or forced their way inside through quickly closing doors. The few left charged forward in their mission, none noticing that Diun was now sharing the sky with the sun, pressing it deeper into the horizon.<br /><br />The dark woman began to move as the harsh, hot light dimmed and a pale silver glow replaced it. The veil of shadows around her began to solidify as she came further into awakening. She shot the last of her arrows across the rooftops and into those stupid enough to come running at such a skilled bowman.<br /><br />Wraethe stood in the center of the street, pulling the dark shafts from the dead and refilling her quiver when the crash of iron-shod horses echoed around the corner. Four strong horses followed four polished pikes, all lowered toward her breast.<br /><br />One last beam of sunlight cut between the clay buildings. Wraethe stepped into it at the last second. The outlines of her shape blurred back out of definition as the pikes cut through her. They passed on, black strips of cloth clinging to the shafts the only trophy of their marksmanship.<br /><br />The beam of sunlight dropped below the horizon, but it did not matter. Diun hung full above the city and Wraethe was angry. She cast aside her tattered cloak, and her pale skin glowed in the moon&rsquo;s light.<br /><br />Her eyes burned bright blue as two riders turned quickly and charged back for a second pass. She lunged toward them, catching the left pike in her hands and rolling right, across the other rider&rsquo;s path. She dug her feet in and wrenched backward like an angry sailor digging her oars into a crashing wave. The animal went down, throwing its rider across the hard cobblestones. Wraethe came up with the pike and held it just long enough to aim and throw. A second rider went down in the dust, his hands clutching the wooden shaft now sticking out of his guts.<br /><br />The horses of the last two riders stood stamping at the end of the street. Wraethe watched her enemies make a quick decision before one turned and disappeared around the corner. The last turned his steed in a circle so tight that it brought the charger up on its hind legs. The man cried a war curse and drove the animal back down at the stone. Sparks exploded from the horse&rsquo;s shoes as they scrambled forward. Wraethe&rsquo;s tongue traced the edges of her lips, as if tasting the cruel smile that formed there.<br /><br />The pale woman leaned easily aside as the head of the long pike passed by. Her body then blurred in motion as she caught the horse&rsquo;s neck between her arms and twisted. The animal&rsquo;s shoulder dropped as its head turned too far around. It tumbled, sliding hard across the street and through the front wall of a cobbler&rsquo;s shop.<br /><br />Wraethe stepped out of the cloud of dust, her hands covered in the bright blood of the dispatched horsemen. She stepped lightly down the street, her stride more as if she were late for dinner than thirsting to find their merchant boss and spin his head off like a child&rsquo;s top.<br /><br />Boruin left the open door of the curio shop from where he had watched Wraethe&rsquo;s furied battle. He placed himself in her path, squared his shoulders, and barred the woman&rsquo;s way. Her eyes burned brighter then Diun&rsquo;s shine, almost casting his shadow across the cobbled avenue. She moved to pass him, but he caught her hand, mindful that he could not hold her. Wraethe leveled her eyes into his, but Boruin did not flinch. Her breath was still frantic, but she did not pull away.<br /><br />&ldquo;You have your rites to give,&rdquo; Boruin said.<br /><br />Her voice was firm, but just barely. &ldquo;Some business comes first.&rdquo; Boruin knew she was being pulled in two directions. Her will was strong, but her desire for more blood was fierce. He was putting his blood before her, and it scared him.<br /><br />Boruin let go of her arm. &ldquo;I will have words with him, if needed. You have your rites to give.&rdquo; She stepped back, her angry eyes still flooding his face with their light.<br /><br />Wraethe turned and dropped to the first of the dead, and Boruin could hear the quiet whisper of her words. Whether they were prayers or some older magic, her words gave them redemption for their sins. The rites also took some measure of corruption from her own and lessened the price of death on her hands. The killing and the rites were a balance of the thinnest edge. Death brought something true out of her; what that was, Boruin couldn&rsquo;t guess. He only knew to thank the Mother for the rites that released her war-rage, kept it from consuming her entirely. Who knew what she would become if left solely to killing?<br /><br />Boruin watched until he was sure she was again calm, sure that her prayers were solemn, driven neither by the sins of the dead nor the rage of her own. When the balance had returned, he turned back to the darkened shop. His own rage settled under his skin as he thought of the words he would indeed have for that bastard Belok.
