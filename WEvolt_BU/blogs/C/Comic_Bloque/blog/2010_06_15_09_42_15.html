<strong>Batman #700</strong></p>
<p>An anniversary issue that consists of one story spread across three timelines. Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne each take their turns at putting together the pieces of a mystery involving time travel and the Joker&rsquo;s journal. It is well written enough but feels a lot like filler whilst the Return of Bruce Wayne plays out in its own series. The last few pages show Batmans from other realities/timelines but don&rsquo;t seem to serve a lot of purpose otherwise. That said, it is a Grant Morrison storyline so there&rsquo;s always a chance that it has more relevance than is immediately apparent<br /><br /><strong>Justice League Generation Lost #3</strong></p>
<p>Things go from bad to worse for the few heroes that remember what Maxwell Lord did. Each discredited or targeted, the current Blue Beatle joins just in time for an OMAC attack. This series continues to offer a nostalgic look at the old JLI comedy created by Giffen, but also acknowledges that most of the characters have progressed and live in a more &lsquo;serious&rsquo; world now. If you&rsquo;re reading this be sure to pick up the latest issue of Booster Gold which also adds to the story.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Six #22</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubting this is a team of super-villains, no matter their intentions or actions. Internal fighting aside, this issue focuses primarily on the conclusion of Blake&rsquo;s (Catman) search for his son and the bloody vengeance he takes on those who kidnapped him. Despite the costumes and villainous past, there is the constant undertone that these are all very damaged people, as much victims of their circumstances and upbringings as the codenames and villain reputations. The ending feels justified and is far from happy.<br /><br /><strong>Astonishing X-Men Xenogenesis #2</strong></p>
<p>Mutant babies in Africa and Warren Ellis&rsquo;s tongue in cheek interpretation on the X-Men make this a fun series. As with the previous &lsquo;Astonishing&rsquo; title, this is considered part of the ongoing X-Men storyline, but lives to one side of events currently occurring all the other X related books. The second issue gives us a whole new explanation for the weird things occurring involving a certain &lsquo;transparent cube-like&rsquo; device.<br /><br /><strong>Avengers Academy #1</strong></p>
<p>Why? Do we really need another series with a team of unknown youngsters? Marvel seem to think so with both this and Young Allies coming out this week. Unfortunately this series falls short in terms of the new characters that have been introduced. None of them are very interesting or engaging, nor is the circumstance that brings them together. The redeeming feature for the series is the already established characters that form the children&rsquo;s teachers. Hank Pym, Justice, Tigra and Speedball (previously Penance). A series focusing only on these &lsquo;broken&rsquo; characters would probably be more interesting.<br /><br /><strong>Captain America #606</strong></p>
<p>With Bucky Barnes firmly cemented as Captain America, now all that remains is for him to start gathering his own version of a rogues gallery. First up is Zemo, who has history with Captain America and Bucky before he took on the mantle. The only oddity in the story is the Fixer&rsquo;s apparent side switching from his Thunderbolts appearance only a few weeks ago. Zemo&rsquo;s appearance in Thunderbolts and here doesn&rsquo;t seem to line up entirely either. What was good to was Red Skull&rsquo;s daughter, Sin, looking very crimson headed herself now.<br /><br /><strong>Daredevil #507</strong></p>
<p>Even when he tries to do the right thing, Matt Murdock is being manipulated into doing the wrong thing for what he thinks is the right reasons. With the Shadowland event coming, this issue serves to show who&rsquo;s manipulating who and sets the stage for what is likely to be a tumultuous few months for hornhead. The series continues to be solidly written, and looks to continue to build on the strengths of showing the &lsquo;darker&rsquo; side of being a hero in New York.<br /><br /><strong>Invincible Iron Man #27</strong></p>
<p>This is Extremis V2.0. What was arguable one of the best Iron Man stories in a long while in Extremis has been upgraded since Tony Stark's "ressurection". The War Machine inclusion in this issue feels a little forced (and potentially a result of the movie) but the Pepper Potts conversations are fantastic. The new suit looks good and seeing Tony trying desperately to do the right thing for the right reasons is refreshing against the arrogance that lead to Civil War. Matt Fraction has made the character his own and hopeful has no intentions of letting him go.<br /><br /><br /><strong>S.H.I.E.L.D. #2</strong></p>
<p>This feels like a Marvel 1602 alternate universe type story, but nothing so far indicates that is what it is intended to be. SHIELD is said to have existed in some form since ancient Egypt, either to advance mankind or protect it. Leonardo Da Vinci is painted as a master architect with a near mutant-like ability to build civilisations or in fact anything he can imagine. Seen through the eyes of a new initiate, in the early twentieth century, so far this series is interesting but confusing. This may be better read as a collected series once it is complete, if only to be able to keep track of what is going on. Amusingly SHIELD is not an acronym in this series.<br /><br /><strong>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #11</strong></p>
<p>Peter Parker, Bobby Drake and Jonny Storm living under Aunt May&rsquo;s roof. Throw in girlfriend Gwen Stacey, a journalistic MJ and an outlaw Kitty Pride and there is a rarely a quiet moment. Aunt May suggests the boys stay out of costume until the chaos of events leading to Kitty&rsquo;s fleeing from the government settles down, however, MJs capture on tape of FBI agents storming a school lead her and Peter back to a rebuilt Daily Bugle. Despite complaints of the younger focus on characters here, Bendis continues to keep a multitude of moving parts turning smoothly together.<br /><br /><strong>Uncanny X-Men #525</strong></p>
<p>Second Coming: Chapter 10. The X-Men and most of San Francisco are under siege by future sentinels and Cyclops sends Cable and X-Force into the &lsquo;Days of Future Past&rsquo; future to put a stop to it all. Given Second Coming is about Hope&rsquo;s return to the X-Men and the implication of her arrival; she has had very little page space so far. Most of the story is still dealing with a war between mutants and Bastion&rsquo;s forces, with Cyclops clearly cast as the general who has to make all the tough choices. As with the previous parts, the stand-out point of the story has been its consistency across all four series it spans so far (not counting the specials and mini-series)<br /><br /><strong>Young Allies #1</strong></p>
<p>The second new team of displaced youngsters for the week does not have much more going for it. Admittedly four of the characters have been around for little longer; Bucky, Arana(Spider-girl), Firestar and Gravity with new comer Toro. That said, there&rsquo;s still very little reason for this group to be functioning as a team, in a series that looks like it will spend as much time on super-heroics as the difficulties of secret identities still attending school/college.
