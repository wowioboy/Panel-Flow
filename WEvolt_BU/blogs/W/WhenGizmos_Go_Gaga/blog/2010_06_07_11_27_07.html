&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECRET SERVICE DUDE <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In: When Gizmos Go Gaga<br />&nbsp; Prelude&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The caverns of brick are dark and dingy with a musky damp smell. The suns light filters through a crack in the wall that at one time a confederate soldier wedged a rifle into. He brought his aim to bear on a square rigged war ship it was one of several blockading Mobile Bay. He pulled the trigger, the rifle round fell short as he suspected it would; just a futile attempt to save his beloved south. Save his south from what he new instinctively, well over a hundred years ago, would be the onslaught of vacationers, sun bathers, fun seekers and golf players for cry&rsquo;n out loud.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That same sun shown then as it does now; through that same crack in the wall of Ft. Morgan which is firmly footed at the bitter end of&nbsp; the peninsula at the mouth of Mobile Bay.&nbsp; Just to the east and immediately outside the perimeter of the fortress is a new fort.&nbsp; This one has air conditioning and rises eight stories reaching for the sun. This fort is built of stucco and glass.&nbsp; It stands fast against the perils of drudgery and the daily work grind. This fort, a beach front condo, is the home to our dashing, smooth, salt and pepper haired Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo, Secret Service Dude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Several hours before sunrise, the moon in it&rsquo;s waning light, settles into the&nbsp; gulf waters to the west. The Capt., sitting on the balcony overlooking the Gulf of Mexico has risen early.</p>
<p>He watches the greenish blue translucent water, the surface, close to the still of a lake on many occasions. This happened to be a night that the salty waters of the gulf fell still except for a two inch high ripple lapping at the sugar white sand beach. He reveals a euphoric, satisfied&nbsp; look on his face.&nbsp; Fulfilled within at having foiled the villains of his latest mission, he is putting his mind into a relaxed mode. The euphonious sound of music floats through the air--no, no, that's his snoring; I mean the other sound, the back ground music, &ldquo;»€ everybody wants to rule the world,&rdquo; a soft rock song he has become very acquainted with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the moon&nbsp; has set and the sun has not as yet made an appearance, the stars stand against the black sky as if to say, &ldquo;this is our moment to shine.&rdquo; The stars would be the last thing Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo saw as his eye lids shuttered closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECRET SERVICE DUDE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Episode 1: GIZMOS GONE GAGA !</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo&rsquo;s (Fllash M.G.) trouser pocket glowed a vibrant purple indicating an emergency. He&nbsp; reached into the pocket of his pajamas and retrieved a smaller than credit card size&nbsp; object.&nbsp; It is his old but still reliable&nbsp; cell phone/multi-purpose&nbsp; visual all dimensional optical maser image caster.&nbsp; &rdquo;Hum,&rdquo; he mused to himself as he mentally turned it on. &ldquo;This thing&rsquo;s a month old and it&rsquo;s still chugging; maybe I should trash this one and get a newer one with more features, before it lets me down.&rdquo; He projected his mind to 'thought answering'; the device stopped flickering. The light slowly subsided, in his head he could hear a young feminine voice. He doesn&rsquo;t need the on-screen name indicator to tell him who is calling.&nbsp; No, this voice he is very familiar with.&nbsp; &ldquo;There now don&rsquo;t sweat it.&rdquo; Fllash M.G. offered as a comfort to the voice on the other end, and then went on to say.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 1<br />&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll text over my hologram image to alert them to my presence in this matter, and I will personally arrive shortly to reinforce my presence.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fllash M.G. flipped the upper cover of his phone to the 'breath checker' device and finding his breath still fresh, he slid the lower key board to one side then checked his hair on the personal image projector.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling confident with his appearance he was about to contact Starmanybucks (inflation) to purchase a cup of 'Capachinolotaimagnifico' from their cellular delivery service.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he got no further in this attempt than tele-communicating to his device the need for an inflatable plastic cup which indeed arrived in anticipation of the Starmanybucks delivery.&nbsp; His thought was interrupted with the vibrant purple light once again alarming an emergency.&nbsp; It was Marry Marry Quite, the same feminine voice as before.&nbsp; In a high pitch she spat out &rdquo;your image didn&rsquo;t come through; you must have had your T.V. down load mode in your thoughts because standing in front of me is an old rerun of 'Who Wants To Be a trillionaire&rsquo;s' host, Regis!"&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary Marry Quite, try to calm yourself. I&rsquo;ll re-project and I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fllash M.G. was a calming influence on Marry Marry Quite who tended toward panic quite easily.&nbsp; Fllash M.G. understood; this time Marry Marry Quite is in real trouble.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Episode 2: Background Music<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fllash Mudd Goo, having received a distressing call from his girlfriend, summoned his loyal side kick, Kateio.&nbsp; Kateio, a brilliant young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, astute in the martial art of Eletrojudio-communication, retrieved Fllash&rsquo;s vintage auto, a deeper than death black, 1959 Mercedes 190 SL. The car is stored in a private enclosure within the multi-story parking garage. Handling&nbsp; the vehicle with the skill of a Tallidaga race course driver, Kateio arrived in front of Fllash M.G.&rsquo;s beach front condo just as the elevator opened. Fllash M.G. stood in the open elevator, he presented an attractive figure at 5'11" displaying excellent posture; a middle aged man with a full head of salt and pepper hair.&nbsp; His face was strong and pleasing although not perfect, his eyes, a dark honesty.&nbsp; His dress, as usual,&nbsp; casual khaki cargo shorts, sock-less with khaki, leather trim deck shoes and a black silk, polo type shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 3<br />The only indication of glitter was his aviator sun glasses, a necessity against the cutting southern sun.&nbsp; He stepped to the curb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio's, wearing apparel, a tropical dress chauffeurs uniform&nbsp; served to disguise Kateio&rsquo;s true purpose. Kateio immediately jumped from the car and went to the passenger side door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening the door for the Capt. Kateio took no notice of the quick pace background music which played aloud, emphasizing the drama of the moment. Kateio had become accustom to it now. Five years earlier when Kateio first started an apprenticeship with Fllash M.G., the site of a four piece combo playing background music for Fllash M.G. as he pursued a mission, stupefied her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fllash M.G. entered the car as Kateio closed the door behind him. The 190 SL, is a two seat, comfortable riding, sporty car, created in the late 50's as a sport personal car. It has only two seats with a small jump seat area behind them this provides only enough space for a medium size child, and at that sitting side ways. The four piece combo continued playing the corresponding music they played exactly the mood appropriate at any moment.&nbsp; Kateio never questioned, never understanding how or when the combo entered the car or for that matter, where they sat, they were just always there.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 4<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fllash M.G. turned to Kateio, queuing&nbsp; her in on the purpose and possibilities of&nbsp; unpleasantries in the mission.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1984 ...&rdquo; Fllash M.G. began.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black Beauty, as the Mercedes has come to be known, cannonballs&nbsp; along gulf beach highway toward impending danger.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Episode 3: Who&rsquo;s The Bad Guy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo&nbsp; explained the intricacies of the mission, Kateio as usual split her attention between break neck speed and understanding the purpose of the mission.&nbsp; Fllash M.G. laid it out for Kateio. &ldquo;As I started to say Kateio, before you swerved to avoid that vacationer. . .&rdquo; the background music toned down from that of, speed enhancing to a soft impending drama. &ldquo;In the year 1984 a group of very wealthy people decided they knew what was best for the world concerning the welfare and prosperity of the people. Along the way they wanted to control and receive unimaginable profits. Unimaginable then.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s the&nbsp; average release pay for a corporate presidential drop out.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio listened closely so as not to miss one word of the instruction that Fllash M.G. would impart. &ldquo;It was a fortunate incident&rdquo; Fllash M.G. went on to instruct,&ldquo;that exposed Big Brother, as they were known and the plot to control the governments of the world. Their intent was to turn the world into one big group of workers with an over-seeing care taker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 6<br />They figured if the populous thought they were in danger from a fake enemy and fake war they could keep them off guard as to what was really going on.&rdquo; The combo drew on a dying swan sound to emphasize the sound that represented despair.&nbsp; Fllash continued, &ldquo;In their plan they would create a massive work force.&nbsp; The more people they control the more wealth they could create.&rdquo; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The background music came out as a Chinese quickstep march.&nbsp; "The catch is, they would have to feed them but the fields were being used to generate energy from food products that normally feed the cattle and populous. Another problem arose.&nbsp; What would be done with the dead?&nbsp; If you burn them you use fuel, if you bury them you use land that could produce fuel? They figured they could solve the problem by&nbsp; grinding the dead into food and making a product that would be inexpensive and plentiful&nbsp; referred to&nbsp; as Soylent Green. Fake wars and the controlled elections, thank goodness never came to be. Not to mention the global corporations controlling and sponsoring games such as Roller Balll."&nbsp; »€ . . . Zoom, zoom, zoom. . .zoom, zoom, zoom, came from the back of the car as the combo accented the statement.&nbsp; "Knock that off!" shouted Fllash M.G., and with that, silence fell on the back of the car.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 7<br />&ldquo; Games were designed to preoccupy the enslaved people while they&nbsp; watched their big wide screen HDV T.V. and munched on KFC.&nbsp; &rdquo;Kateio's head shook in disbelief.&nbsp; "Your telling me, Mr. M.G., that we came close to being enslaved with seemingly a freewill but in actuality, we would have been totally controlled?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeh, like a school of fish&rdquo; responded Fllash M.G.&nbsp; The background music struck a note to punctuate the point.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />To be continued</p>

<p>&nbsp; Episode 4: Ah!</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purple light of the cell phone throbbed and alternated to yellow. As the cell phone reacted purely to "thought," needing no other activation, Fllash M.G.'s mind commanded it to answer.&nbsp; It was the strong voice of his superior, the Field Director. &ldquo;Yes sir, yes, I&rsquo;m aware, yes sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fllash M.G.&rsquo;s lips never parted, as the phone captured his every thought and passed it to the cell phone of the Field Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black 190 SL streaked along the coastal beach. The occupants maintained a silence. Each reflected on the conversation that had just taken place. The combo fell silent also; it seems that there was no music to stress the point of silence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Fllash M.G. that spoke first. &ldquo;Well... Big Brother was stopped, the people woke up. What we didn&rsquo;t know at the time, is they managed to create a computer program and imbedded its basic programs of the day.&nbsp; It was primitive but has proven to be very effective. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 9<br />The program was activated in the year 2000. They couldn&rsquo;t do it sooner because the technology wasn&rsquo;t developed to support it. The program has slowly grown stronger through the years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black Beauty, under control of an expert hand, came to a quiet, easy stop in front of a dental office. This type of stop is often employed by professional secret service dudes to foil the bad actors of the plot. Often preferred to screeching breaks, sliding side ways into parking spots and slamming doors in a hasty departure from the vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio quickly came around the car to the passenger side and opened Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo&rsquo;s car door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fllash M.G. and Kateio headed to the office, Kateio put a cautioning hand on Fllash M.G.s arm and asked, &ldquo;what should&nbsp; we expect to find in there?&rdquo; With a somber face that reflected a deeper knowledge of the situation than he was prepared to state, he simply said, &ldquo;we should fully expect to find". . . then he paused with much consideration and said, &ldquo;Marry Marry Quite,. . . in trouble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Episode 5: Hologram!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The agents Fllash M.G. and Kateio entered the lobby/waiting room of Dr. Pullum Plenty D.D. S. Kateio remarked to Fllash M.G. about the lack of patients in the lobby/waiting room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; replied Fllash M.G. and then he went on to explain the events of an earlier phone conversation. &ldquo;I somehow managed to teleport a hologram of Regis.&nbsp; You know the host of that trillionaire up dated and inflated $54,000 Dollar Question T.V. show of the sixties. He&rsquo;s probably pumping them full of nitrous oxide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 11<br />If you think about it, this would be the only way he could get laughs in a dentist office.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Hey,&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Capt. M. G., that&rsquo;s his hologram there in the corner,&rdquo; as Kateio pointed to a flickering lite image in the corner of the receptionist&lsquo;s cubicle, &ldquo;well I&rsquo;ll be . . . it is.<br />Why do you think he&rsquo;s standing in the corner facing the wall,&rdquo; asked a curious Fllash M.G. without really&nbsp; expecting an answer? Fllash M.G. approached the image with a cautious and polite demeanor. &rdquo;Excuse me, ah . . . Regis?&rdquo; The hologram slowly turned around, looked directly at Fllash M.G. Saying nothing he slowly turned his head toward Kateio, his eyes traveled up and down taking in Kateio&rsquo;s presence. Looking back to Fllash M.G. he said with a bitter tone, &ldquo;I heard you. You know?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah . . . yeah, think I can get an autograph, &rdquo;Fllash M.G. asked politely? The hologram displayed a total look of bewilderment which was generated from the thought that anyone could have the chutzpah to ask for an autograph after just insulting them. Regis&rsquo; hologram took a second to gather his thoughts, then replied with his hands feathering out about waist level in a display of hopelessness toward the man standing in front of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hologram you half-wit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeh,&nbsp; . . . I thought maybe digitally,&nbsp; ya&nbsp; know?&rdquo; Suggested a hopeful Fllash M.G., sheepishly. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Shouted the hologram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 12<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio, seeing where the conversation was going interjected, &ldquo;pardon my breaking in on this mutual admiration, but why are you still here?&rdquo; addressing the hologram of Regis, in a bemused voice. &rdquo;The phone!&rdquo; Regis&rsquo; hologram responded in a stale flat voice, &ldquo;The phone,&rdquo; Fllash M.G. interjected, in a knowing&nbsp; voice.&nbsp; Kateio once again addressed the hologram, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Marry Marry Quite dis-n-phase your hologram?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;»€Ta ta taa tum,&rdquo; the background music flowed in dramatic notes</p>

<p><br />Episode 6: Giggle Gas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;»€Ta&nbsp; ta&nbsp; taa&nbsp; tum,&rdquo; the background music coursed in dramatic notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t Marry Marry dis-n-phase his hologram? Kateio addressed her commander realizing that Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo had some insight into what Regis' hologram had just said. &ldquo;The phone would not allow my image to transmit, so it substituted&nbsp; Regis&rsquo;s hologram instead,&rdquo; was Fllash&rsquo;s soft response.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The combo was a clever combination of bass fiddle, baby grand piano and the short guy who played a tambourine while plucking a mouth harp at the same time (try that). They were at a loss for a type of music to fit the occasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stood motionless in the opposite corner of the receptionist cubical transfixed by the melodrama&nbsp; unfolding before their eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 14<br />&nbsp;&ldquo;She just started giggling,&rdquo;&nbsp; Regis&rsquo; hologram commented, &ldquo;the blue haired little old lady that was waiting for the doctor to return laughed at first, then fell asleep from the effect of the gas.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio took the cell phone from a holster strap attached to the side of the chauffeur&rsquo;s hat, flipped open the face cover, slid the key board to one&nbsp; side, did&nbsp; Rubrics Cube movements on the main body which released the tripod that descended until it hit hard ground. This became such a smooth movement, thanks to all the cell phone improvement over the last month that it took place within a few nanoseconds.&nbsp; Kateio looked directly into Fllash Mudd Goo&rsquo;s eyes which indicated that she wanted permission. Fllash M.G. nodded positively, and Kateio&rsquo;s mind thought the Regis hologram dis-n-phased. The hologram dimmed and was gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fllash M.G. slid to the wall on the same side of the room as the door to the dental exam office. He was followed immediately by Kateio.&nbsp; They were using the Secret Service Dude&rsquo;s approach, 7m3. Let&rsquo;s see that would be page 63 in the Secret Service Dude&rsquo;s Manual, oh, there it is.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 15<br />It says here that it translates to &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so stupid, you don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ve been here for the last seven (7) minutes (m). So, we&rsquo;re going to sneak up on you in three(3),slick moves.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br />&nbsp; Episode 7: Dental Dilemma&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capt. Fllash with his back against the wall and palms flat on the wall, gave Kateio the nod.&nbsp; Understanding the authorized nod, Kateio did a body roll and landed feet flat on the floor coming&nbsp; to a standing posture position.&nbsp; In front of her was the door leading to the examination room.&nbsp; Ring,&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; ring,&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; ring.&nbsp; It was the receptionist&rsquo;s phone demanding attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well are you going to answer it,&rdquo; asked the Captain, directing his question to Kateio? &ldquo;Yes sir, immediately sir,&rdquo;Kateio reached down and picked up the receiver, along with a pad and pen. &ldquo;Good morning Dr. Pullum Plenty&rsquo;s office,&rdquo;Kateio answered. (I will add, it was a cheery voice that Kateio used under the circumstances.&nbsp; Look out Marry Marry Quite, Kateio may have your job when this is all over.) &ldquo;No Mam.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capt. Mudd Goo burst through the door to the Exam Room, Kateio followed immediately. Both stopped as quickly as they entered.&nbsp; Before them was Marry Marry Quite sitting in a chair flossing uncontrollably.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Marry Marry Quite was flossing so vigorously, that the office desk chair, in which she sat, was spinning in circles. She flossed to the left, she flossed to the right, she flossed up and down, she was floss&rsquo;n with delight! The chair was not only spinning, it was also circling the room at an accelerated speed. Zoom . . . zoom . . . zoom.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio instinctively reached out to intercept the chair, and with that, the Capt. grabbed Kateio&rsquo;s arm, pulling it back before it could engage the chair. &ldquo;No, Kateio, let it spin. Until we find out the cause of this tragic event, we must not interfere.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why is that sir,&rdquo;Kateio questioned?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 19</p>
<p>Not out of disrespect, but rather due to a thirst for the knowledge that Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo possessed and could impart. The combo was right on top of things, with,&nbsp; »€. . . turning ever turning, like windmills in my mind. Zoom . . . zoom . . . zoom.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Episode 9: Pinball, Anyone?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course of the marathon flossing, Marry found herself spinning and bouncing off things like a pinball off of rubber guards. Watching the ordeal gave Capt. Fllash M.G. an idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kateio, bumpers!&rdquo; Capt. Fllash M.G. yelled out enthusiastically.&nbsp; With shrugged shoulder and a puzzled facial formation, Kateio responded with, &ldquo;bumpers, bumpers Sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes bumpers, find something to use as a bumper.&nbsp; We will have to flip her as you would a pin ball bumper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Capt. Fllash M.G. said as he expressed himself with both hands making a flipper motion.&nbsp; I never played pinball, however I have played ping pong, &rdquo;Kateio offered.&ldquo;&nbsp; "Then think of it as a paddle and wack&rsquo;er back in to the outer office,&rdquo; suggested the Capt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third turn around the room, spinning delightfully and unaware the rest of the world spins in a different direction.&nbsp; Marry Marry Quite arrived at an intersection and corresponding obtuse angle to come together with the exact projection, in combination with the force of Kateio&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 21<br />&nbsp;(So that&rsquo;s why they teach algebra!)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marry Marry Quite came flying through the door much to the shock of a little blue haired lady that had just come out of a deep sleep and was sort of wandering around the office in no particular direction.&nbsp; Marry Marry Quite came to a slow stop in front of the sweet older person.&nbsp; The flossing also came to an end. Capt. Fllash M.G. understood why the sudden change in Marry Marry Quite&rsquo;s dental hygiene habit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 23</p>
<p>&ldquo;There on the floor beside the water dispenser,&rdquo; Capt. Fllash M.G. motioned to Kateio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quickly Kateio turn it off."&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio grabbed the phone!&nbsp; Too Kateio&rsquo;s chagrin, it was a relatively new cell.&nbsp; &ldquo;She must have gotten it this morning, I&rsquo;m not sure how to disarm it physically!&rdquo;&nbsp; A distressed Kateio spurted out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio began turning things, twisting, Rubic Cubing but with no apparent success.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marry Marry Quite&rsquo;s cell had more flip outs than a Swiss army knife.&nbsp; It was luck that our heros pushed Marry Marry Quite far from the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a suggestion to the Captain, Kateio offered to take the phone out through the back exit of the exam room and lock it in the special lead metal lined trunk that all secret service dudes have fabricated into there special vehicles.</p>

<p><br />&nbsp; Episode 11: Secret Laboratory&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kateio exited the back door of the exam room. The Capt. immediately went to Marry Marry Quite and assured himself she was unhurt. The Capt. also attended to Mrs. Bumstead. He recognized the little old blue haired lady and introduced himself. &ldquo;Excuse me Mam but are you Blondie, and your husband is Dag&rsquo; something or other, forgive me, but his name escapes me. I think his name has to do with lumber or foliage or something like that, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh sweety,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nice that you remember, but they call me, Bluezie now.&rdquo; Finding that both ladies were in fine spirit, Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo joined Kateio at the 190sl in the parking area of the Dentists&rsquo; office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 25<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black Beauty once again streaked along Beach highway in the very capable hand&rsquo;s of Kateio. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; »€ Dixie, rump, dixie rump, dixie rump, dixie rump, dump, dump, the combo was right on the mark but in the wrong serial.&nbsp; The Capt. was the first to speak, &ldquo;once we get to the lab, we will have to gather all the cell phones with up grades, beginning with the year 2000.&rdquo; Noting the Captain&rsquo;s deep concern and eager to assure him that it would be taken care of directly, Kateio replied with confidence,&ldquo; I&rsquo;ll get right on that, it should be rather easy. Just a point of interest, sir,&rdquo; Kateio went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;The last time I checked was about a week ago and the count then was 740. I think there may be in the neighborhood of approximately 780 upgrades,.&nbsp; .&nbsp; . that&rsquo;s just a guess Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret number was pressed into the key lock, the chain link gate slid back and the black 190sl moved slowly along a row of garage doors, each displaying a sequential number. The 190sl came to a stop about four doors from the end. It was number&nbsp; seventy eleven in the Beach self store rental complex.</p>

<p>EPISODE 12: Get Out and Push</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this the one?&rdquo; Capt. Fllash asked aloud, questioning his memory more than Kateio&rsquo;s recollection. &ldquo;Yes sir I do believe so, actually I&rsquo;m certain,&rdquo; responded Kateio, with a little exasperation and a small amount of justification in her voice, Capt. M.G. remarked, &ldquo;Well they all&nbsp; look alike,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; The orange overhead garage door with&nbsp; the number seventy eleven, rolled up, revealing a 10ft wide by 4 ft deep storage area.&nbsp; Black beauty rolled up to the open door and into the empty garage. The car&rsquo;s front wheels no sooner touched the entrance when the back wall of the garage sprung partly open. &ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; a frustrated Capt. Fllash M.G. blurted out, &ldquo;we have to get that fixed.&rdquo; The Capt.&nbsp; Shook his head side to side and went on to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get out and push it back again, but the first chance we get, make a call and get someone to fix this thing.&rdquo; He paused for a moment and then said, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t use a cell phone!&nbsp; &rdquo;Kateio could hear the Capt. mumbling to himself, &ldquo;they can make cell phones that control your mind but they still can&rsquo;t make a simple automatic secret door opener that&rsquo;s reliable.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />To be continued&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 27</p>

<p><br />Episode 13: Smash&rsquo;m, Trash&rsquo;m!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Once inside the secret laboratory Kateio parked the car in one corner and went directly to the work bench where Capt. Fllash M.G. was in the process of dumping the first box of early model cell phones. &ldquo;Here Kateio&rdquo; Capt. Fllash M.G. passed the first phone sliding it along the bench to where Kateio stood, screw driver ready and eager to get started. &ldquo;Sir, what is it we are looking for?&rdquo;Kateio questioned, putting the screwdriver to the back of the first cell phone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,...ah, what are you doing,&rdquo; questioned Capt. Fllash M.G.?&nbsp; He continued, &ldquo;I mean with that screwdriver?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well sir I&rsquo;m taking them apart.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; sorry, here take this, it will be faster.&rdquo; &ldquo;A ball-peen hammer, Sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; &ldquo;You want me to hit it?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; I want you to smash it!"&nbsp; Kateio took the hammer and taped the cell reluctantly. "Kateio we have a lot of cell phones to get through and a short time to do it, so please WACK THAT SUCKER!&rdquo; With that Kateio put on his safety glasses, wound up and whammed the cell phone. Pieces flew everywhere. The Capt, reached for his safety glasses and they both went into a smashing frenzy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three hours later, (I know it was three hours because it was time for lunch.) found them tiring and they were only halfway through. The Lab was a mess.&nbsp; Pieces of cell phones lay at their feet, on the bench, on the shelving, in their hair and still nothing. That is when Kateio asked again, &ldquo;Sir, what are we looking for?&rdquo; &ldquo;A clue Kateio, a clue.&rdquo;Kateio picked up the hammer and continued smashing one cell, another cell and then another, when she heard in her head a familiar sound, that of a communication device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a common mind interactive thought generating, minervial response just like any common cell phone thought communicator of the day. &ldquo; DON&rsquo;T HURT ME!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Get the manufacturers&rsquo; model identification number from the case.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah . . .&nbsp; but I just smashed it, Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, find the parts and reassemble it,&rdquo; directed Capt. Fllash M.G. in a firm positive voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, excuse me, Sir, but have you looked around us recently?&nbsp; There are parts intermingled with parts.&nbsp; It will take months to reconstruct that one phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, are you guys in there?&rdquo;&nbsp; Came a loud voice from outside of the orange roll up garage door, which was in fact now rolled down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah jeees, Marry Marry Quite, I&rsquo;ve asked you not to come banging on the secret lab door.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you took my cell phone.&nbsp; Move on in now, what are you two doing about my cell phone? You know I need it and the new ones won&rsquo;t be available until tomorrow afternoon. They&rsquo;re really slick though, you gotta see them, they have an ultrasound mode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Kateio announced, with a voice that had a bit of, hooray for me, in it.&nbsp; The combo which had been on break and is now well rested, put together several notes of, &ldquo;»€ isn&rsquo;t it great, isn&rsquo;t it wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it fine?&rdquo; From the screen play, Chicago. &ldquo;The assembly was by the, ICFYA ( I Can Find You Anywhere ) Cell Phone Manufacturing Co., but listen to this. The chip that drives the mind interface was given free to the manufacturer. Guess who! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 32<br />The group known as the Bilderberg.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kateio went on to answer.&nbsp; Kateio could never wait for a response in question and answer games.&nbsp; .&nbsp; . (very impatient).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your old nemesis Capt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kateio reminded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes indeed, Kateio.&nbsp; &rdquo;Marry Marry Quite was growing very bewildered with it all and commented to the Capt. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go get them Darling?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Yes of course, Kateio, contact the field commander, inform him of our discovery. I&rsquo;m sure he will stop the mind interface chips from being inserted into the new cell phones. Also remind him to recall the other models going back as far as May 21, 2003.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capt. Fllash Mudd Goo turned to Marry Marry Quite and asked, &ldquo;what do you think about a vacation in Bilderberg country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that like Amish country,&rdquo; asked Marry Marry Quite?</p>
