Welcome to  Friday! We&rsquo;re covering the last half of the top 10 here at WEvolt and  hope to fill your weekend with comic reading goodness.&nbsp;&nbsp;So let&rsquo;s get to it and dive into what will be owning MY leisure time this weekend!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="../../The_Unwanted/#The%20Unwanted" target="_blank">The  Unwanted:</a></strong> It&rsquo;s like taking the BEST parts of a horror movie, pairing it  with fabulous art, packaging it up, and giving it to you to read online  for free.&nbsp;Trapped inside a juvenile detention center, a group of  street-smart teens battle for their souls against a demon that feeds on  society's "unwanted" kids!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="../../American_Wasteland" target="_blank">American Wasteland:</a></strong> A wonderful title from publisher Arcana about a  gnarly trucker up against even gnarlier vampire like creatures. His  name is even Cletus! This story is great when you need to get a fix of  blood and guts and the good guys taking down the bad guys with an axe  and a hack saw!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="../../Blaed_Race/" target="_blank">Blaed Race:</a></strong> This beautifully drawn comic provides you with 100% of  your daily recommended sci fi and space adventure. Planet Blaed has  held a contest of battle to determine rulership for thousands of years.  This law is called the Race, but this law will be challenged by one  unlikely resident and a new movement will emerge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.creepycarly.com" target="_blank">Creepy Carly:</a> </strong>No no, that&rsquo;s not a nifty Photoshop effect, this  single panel chibi comic about an unusual little girl is really drawn on  yellow lined paper with a blue Pilot G-2-07 pen. This comic is a cute  and funny strip about a murderous, sadistic little girl that kills  people and tortures animals. Yes, we said cute and funny. See for  yourself.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="../../Wevolt_Trinity/" target="_blank">WEvolt Trinity:</a></strong>The Path&rsquo;s creator James Riot teamed up with  Phinmagic&rsquo;s creator Barry Linck to create a crossover comic of EPIC  proportions. Phinmagic&rsquo;s Sarah and&nbsp;&nbsp;Phinus team up with The  Path&rsquo;s Chance to fight the forces of evil and all that is Cthulhu and  Lovecraftian, or for short, more awesome that you can shake a stick at.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the WEvolt top 10! Some are in the Rumble some are not,  regardless they&rsquo;ve been proven by the masses to be great reads. So check  them out and vote for your favorites!
