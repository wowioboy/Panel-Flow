<strong><span style="font-size: small;">Tips for Experienced Creators</span></strong></p>
<p>New to WEvolt but an old hand at webcomics? Great! Thanks for joining our community! This blog post is for you. We've got a couple of tips to help you get the most out of WEvolt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WEvolt generates revenue for PROFESSIONAL creators by readers subscribing to them for $2 per month. We take a buck and remove all the ads, and you get the other buck. Here's three quick tips to getting your readers to subscribe to you. We call it the three C's:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSISTENCY: We really recommend that you don't upload all your content at once. Establish a regular update schedule and stick to it. Reliability and consistency is the key to getting readers to subscribe to you. (Also, if you're in the Rumble we only count 5 pages per week, so save some pages for next week!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSOLIDATION: There's no need to send your audience to an archive on another hosting site. Why divide your hits and play your hand (see above)? If you&rsquo;re a pro user, WEvolt provides you with a syndication widget allowing you to continue updating on those sites while consolidating your audience in one place. Focus your efforts where you can generate revenue, and audience will go there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; COMMUNICATION: If you're posting old content, make it new by adding comments like a director's commentary. Just a few sentences with your pages helps people see that there is a person behind the comic they love. &nbsp;The more you can let them know that there's someone behind the curtain, the more they will come back, chat and listen to any of your requests. eg. Rumble help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That should get you to a good start on WEvolt. The key to becoming an online professional publishing powerhouse is Consistency, Consolidation and Communication.</p>
