<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok.&nbsp; I'll admit it.&nbsp; I loved the first Tron movie, and I'm kind of excited for the reboot "Tron Legacy" that hits theaters next month. What I'm not psyched about is the fact we're in full force on the movie marketing. From crappy toys to video games, Disney is JAMMIN' "Tron" down our throats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After playing "Tron: Evolution" at this year's E3, I thought it was pretty solid, so I hope it doesn't SUCK because video games that come out before the movie is released...tend to SUCK.</p>
