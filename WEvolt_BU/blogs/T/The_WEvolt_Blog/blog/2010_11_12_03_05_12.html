<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Weekly Wrap Up-Royal Rumble, Fixes, New Features, Oh My!</strong></span></p>
<p>Hello and Welcome to the Friday blog. We&rsquo;ve had some super sweet stuff going on this week. Let&rsquo;s recap!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rumblers! You have less than 12 hours to get your &ldquo;likes&rdquo;, fans that goes for your &ldquo;liking&rdquo; too! Week Three flew by and there&rsquo;s only one week left in Round One! Next week&rsquo;s winner will go onto the ROYAL RUMBLE for the big $500 prize. So Rumblers need to kick it into gear and put on their Rockstar glasses &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s time to throw down.</p>
<p>Bugs were fixed. ALL the rollovers (like on the header/menu buttons) work! Also we&rsquo;re reworking the modules, WE CAN MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE, well when it comes to modules anyway. Let us know what CUSTOM modules you&rsquo;d like <a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=146&amp;board=149&gt;">here in the forum!</a> Get creative! I&rsquo;m requesting one that makes gummy bears! (j/k)&nbsp;</p>
<p>We love to hear your feedback, YOU are the people  that make WEvolt! Own it! We got some feedback from user <a href="../../Blaed_Race/">Sostan, artist of  Blaed Race</a>, it was a great idea so Matt created&nbsp; two new homepage  templates. Now you can do one and three column layouts.&nbsp; You can find these spiffy new features in the CMS under Manage  Content&gt;&gt;Home-Edit Template Settings. Tinker Away! Matt loves it when you find new ways to break his code! (snicker, snicker)</p>
<p>We want to PIMP your comic!&nbsp; Post your comic milestones in <a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=252&amp;board=291">the forum here</a> and we will put them in the Monday blog post and tweet them to the fans!</p>
<p>HEY! If you&rsquo;re an LA local, head over to GOLDEN APPLE from 6-9 tonight (Friday 11/12). WEvolt creator Carly Mizzou will be collecting money for the Hero Inititiave, and if that isn&rsquo;t enough (it should be!) you can meet Tim Sale, AND there&rsquo;s free food and booze! Score! <a href="http://www.goldenapplecomics.com">Info is HERE</a></p>
<p>Lastly if you need help, want a walk through, or have an idea for the site send it to carly(at)wevolt.com and we'll jump on it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all folks! See ya again on Monday!
