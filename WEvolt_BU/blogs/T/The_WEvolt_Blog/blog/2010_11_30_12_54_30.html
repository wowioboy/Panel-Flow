<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>There's a Rumble at the end of Movember</strong></span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a VERY eventful day today, lots to announce and all of it awesome, and all of it to help someone in some way. (awww, warm fuzzy kittens and grilled cheese!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off,  the WEvolt Weekly Rumble Recap (say that ten times fast!). Round One was SWEPT by <a href="../../High_School_Heroes/" target="_blank">James Mascia&rsquo;s High School Heroes</a> so he will go onto the Lord of the Rumble for a chance to be the ultimate Rumble champion and  get a crack at $500 cash money. Bling and Bling!</p>
<p>Monday kicked off Round Two of the Weekly Rumble and since High School Heroes has moved onto the Lord of the Rumble, it&rsquo;s between the remaining Round One competitors and any new guys that enter ring. What? You mean you didn&rsquo;t know YOU can still enter your comic in the Rumble for a chance to win $100? Yeah there&rsquo;s four weeks to a round, so that&rsquo;s four chances to win cash and move onto the Lord of the Rumble and all it&rsquo;s glory (oh yeah and that $500 prize)</p>
<p>If you are a CREATOR go here to enter your comic<br /> <a href="../../rumble.php?s=details" target="_blank">Yeah HERE if you wanna be a webcomic superstar!</a></p>
