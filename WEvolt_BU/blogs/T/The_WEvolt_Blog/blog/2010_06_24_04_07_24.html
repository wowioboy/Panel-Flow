<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUICK UPDATES: Matt and I just sat down and figured out what we're going to have done by July 1st, Comic Con and then the stuff we've had to shelve until after Comic Con. Suffice to say we have an incredible amount of ideas. We have super-coder Dan Kram rebuilding WEvolt into a more stable platform as Matt and I busily try and build new stuff.</p>
<p>Matt's looking over the new reader I designed now, and I can't wait to upload it. If the other one is a beaten up car you found at a sketchy used dealer, this one is the latest model roll-out from the factory. I'm not gonna say that it's a concept super car, as I always like to leave the gate open for more. Pro's will be able to have multiple reader colors, with the default one being grey so they can pick one that works for their page design.</p>
<p>But lets get onto today's fun to do:</p>
<p>LISTS!!!</p>
<p>Your MYvolt pages are for you to create personal dynamic lists. Your WEvolt page is where you can create lists to share with other people. I covered MYvolt lists last blog post, so lets do WEvolt lists today.</p>
<p>Why the hell would you want to share lists of your stuff? Because even though you're not David Letterman it's one of the most fun games you can play.</p>
<p>So what sort of lists do you want to share with your friends?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanna start the first game with MOVIE lists.</p>
<p>I've put together my top FIVE films.</p>
<p>You can go to my WEVOLT page <a title="Jason's WEvolt page" href="http://users.wevolt.com/jasonbadower/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to find them.</p>
<p>Now you can't see them initially, because it's hidden behind my FAVORITE WEBCOMICS tab. Click on the drop down, select FAVORITE MOVIES and you will be able to see them. Why didn't I just make them the main tab? Because I want you to realize that every person's page might have multiple drop downs for you to explore.</p>
<p>Make your top 5/10/15/20/100 movie lists and share them with your friends!
