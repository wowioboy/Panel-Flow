<p>JASON SAYS:</p>
<p><strong>WELCOME TO WEVOLT!</strong></p>
<p>We are live!</p>
<p>I'm Jason Badower the site's co-creator and designer. I'm a comic book writer and artist having worked on HEROES, TRUE BLOOD and the upcoming <a href="../../Big_Trouble_In_Little_China/reader/page/1/#Episode 1" target="_blank">BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA</a>.</p>
<p>And what an auspicious day! Webcomics giant ZUDACOMICS.com run by DC comics closed its doors today. And now, a new webcomics giant steps into the ring instead. The biggest differences are:</p>
<p>1. We don't take any ownership of your property. WEvolt will never a single percent of your ownership ever in perpetuity until the end of time, throughout the known universe or until Galactus eats the planet.</p>
<p>2. We look after fans. We give each fan their own web page to organize and share content with their friends. Found something cool? Share it!</p>
<p>But now we're live, I wanna thank my partner in crime fighting, the second half of the dynamic duo and the Superman to my Krypto, Matt Jacobs. Matt co-created and coded the site you see before you.</p>
<p>We recently brought on the incredibly talented, code-bender Dan Kram to help Matt and they've made an amazing team.</p>
<p>I also wanna thank everyone who sent in bugs. We've almost got them all, but if you find any others post them at our:</p>
<p><a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=141&amp;board=86" target="_blank">BUG SQUASHING FORUM!</a></p>
<p>And the biggest question is...</p>

<p>Here's a quick 2.5min video I made and posted to YOUTUBE. I will post it again in our tutorial section (when I've finished designing it!).</p>
<p>Then I'm gonna follow it up with a bunch of uh... tutorials.</p>
