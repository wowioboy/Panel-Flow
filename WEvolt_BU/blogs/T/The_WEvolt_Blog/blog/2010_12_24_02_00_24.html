<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Happy Holidays, Rumble Round 2 Final Day!</span></strong></p>
<p>Happy Holidays everyone! I&rsquo;m going to keep this short, cause, well it&rsquo;s Christmas Eve and I have trees to trim and carols to sing and fun to have. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we at WEvolt never sleep and today is a HUGE day. It&rsquo;s the last day of the Rumble Round Two! We will be announcing the Week Four and overall Round Two winner on Monday. So make sure you get your votes in before Midnight Pacific time and help your favorite webcomic creators have the ULTIMATE New Year!</p>
