<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>All About Modules<br /></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modules are boxes that you can place on your HOME or READER template to display content or information. Modules need to be created and, to be displayed, placed into your HOME or READER template.&nbsp; Each module has settings that can be changed to display information to your liking, but ALL modules have the following settings.</p>
<p><img src="http://wevolt.com/blogs/T/The_WEvolt_Blog/media/module_2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: This is how the text or content is aligned in your module. &nbsp;You can choose from Default (reverts to your global setting), Left, Center, Right</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Available on</strong>: You have check boxes for HOME and READER, whichever ones you check will make that module available in the AVAILABLE MODULE menu on that specific page. If you don&rsquo;t check either, the module will not show up in either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enter the title of the project as it appears in the URL when viewing the project (leave default value for current project)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>What does this mean? As it says if you want the module to display information pulled from the current project you are working on then leave it as is. If you have multiple projects, and you want the module to display information from a different project then enter its title here. Just make sure you enter it as IT APPEARS IN THE URL.</p>
<p><strong>Remeber when you have your modules in the order that you like within your template, YOU MUST CLICK THE YELLOW SAVE BUTTON. Otherwise any changes you made to the order will be lost.</strong></p>
