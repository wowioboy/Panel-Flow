<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Week Three Winner, and New Features</strong></span></p>
<p>Winner, winner chicken dinner! It&rsquo;s Monday and we have tons of great announcements. First, our week three winner! Wait for it, wait for it&hellip;High School Heroes takes it again! &nbsp;Congratulations! Next we&rsquo;ve been listening to your feedback and have created some new modules and features. Check it out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Superfan Module</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finally here, we now have a module that you can use to transform your audience from average fanboys into Superfans of your comic. Not only is it easier to get that warm fuzzy feeling of fandom, this is another module that helps your comic generate money!</p>
<p><strong>Design Capability Update</strong></p>
<p>We saw how much you LOVED the new one and three column templates so we thought why stop there?! You can now better customize the background of your comic reader by changing the color and adding rounded corners. Spiffy!</p>
<p>We aim to please, but we need YOUR feedback to build a better site. How can you help?&nbsp;</p>
