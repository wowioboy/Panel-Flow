So as most of you have noticed WEvolt has started to take on a new look in certain areas of the site with a much improved design and UI. In the coming weeks we will be rolling out all the new sections. Other than simplified and focused navigation the biggest change will be in the MYVOLT section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're pretty excited to roll it out and show you what we've been up to since the site went live a few months ago. We've learned alot about the overall experience on WEvolt with some great feedback from users and creators. Yes. We have been listening!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So other than the shiny new design, expect a bunch of exciting features for both creators and users in the coming months. Also to help the effort of everything we have going on with WEvolt, and our other sites like <a href="http://www.drunkduck.com" target="_blank">Drunk Duck</a> and <a href="http://www.wowio.com" target="_blank">WOWIO</a>, we've been able to bring on some great folks to join the team. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't met our Community Manager yet, Carly Wager came onboard during Comic Con and is here to help all of you! She's been writing up some FAQs and tutorials that will be finally getting posted, which will be a huge help to everyone. She's also a creator, check out her series <a href="../../Creepy_Carly/" target="_blank">Creepy Carly</a>.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the <a href="../../calendar.php" target="_blank">EVENTS</a>&nbsp;page as Carly is organizing a bunch of fun events both on WEvolt, conventions, and locations around the LA area.</p>
<p>We've also brought on a lead programmer Dan Kram, who has been responsible for making WEvolt bigger, better, faster! Dan's been doing a great job and keeping Jason and Matt in line with all the features on the board. &nbsp;He's also a writer, so expect some stuff from him in the future.</p>
<p>More updates to coming, the next few months are going to present a lot of opportunity and exciting changes for WEvolt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So stay tuned!</p>
