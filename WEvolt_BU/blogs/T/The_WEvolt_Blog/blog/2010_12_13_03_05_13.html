<span style="font-size: medium;">RUMBLE WINNER: THE PATH!</span><br />It&rsquo;s Monday so you know what that means&hellip;we&rsquo;ve got another Rumble winner! Last week was DOMINATED&nbsp; by THE PATH written and drawn by WEvolt uber-creator, JAMES RIOT. THE PATH has been a mainstay of WEvolt&rsquo;s top ten pretty much since we opened our doors to you, our amazing audience. It&rsquo;s great to see that Jame&rsquo;s fans have rallied and attacked the Rumble, crushing its enemies before it and hearing the lamentations of their women.</p>
