<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Rumble Round 3 Begins!</span></strong><br />It is the final round of the Rumble! If you've been putting it off, now's the time to get into it. Get your creative juices started for the year with a chance at $100 every week this month and another $100 if you get the most Facebook and WEvolt "Likes" this month. Then on February the 7th we start the LORD OF THE RUMBLE where all our winners compete for the grand daddy prize of $500.<br /><br />Every page you upload that week counts, so make sure you keep updating as every new piece of content is an opportunity for more likes.<br /><br />It's as easy as making a free account and signing up for the Rumble. Then get all your friends, family and fans to start "liking" it on Facebook and on WEvolt.&nbsp; It's so easy! If you have any questions email us at info@wevolt.com.<br /><br /><br />HIGH SCHOOL HEROES<br /><br />Something we&rsquo;ve had on the horizon and been dying to break comes from our Round One winner, James Mascia and his winning story High School Heroes. Now it&rsquo;s almost done, we&rsquo;re putting together a digital download book available on WOWIO with extras, character sketches, and commentary. Look for this to be coming very soon!</p>
