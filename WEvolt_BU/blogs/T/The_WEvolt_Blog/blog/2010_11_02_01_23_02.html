<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 39pt; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">I am first and foremost a writer, I think I always have been even going back as far as my childhood when I made my own books for my mother to read to me. However, aside from being a writer, I am also a teacher. I teach, not at all ironically, English and Writing at both the high school and college levels. </span></em></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 39pt; line-height: normal;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: "><span style="font-size: x-small;">As far as getting into webcomics, I suppose you can say I kind of fell into it. I had no intention of doing a webcomic, or a comic book at all when I started writing, but I met some artists at a comic convention, and we gave something a try. Unfortunately, the first project was an absolute failure, but it was a learning experience. Now I&rsquo;m working with some other people and making some higher quality stuff. </span><br /></span></em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 39pt;">2)<span style="font: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How long have you been doing High School Heroes and what was your inspiration?</p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>High School Heroes has a long story, and again, was never intended to be a comic at all. As a matter of fact, when I started High School Heroes, I was doing my best to make it anything but a comic. At a comic convention a few years ago, I met a man named Frank Byrnes who published a quarterly magazine called </em>A Thousand Faces <em>which is a journal of superhuman fiction. While talking to him, we discussed how there wasn&rsquo;t any real prose fiction involving superheroes. So, I set out to write one. I ended up writing about five short stories for </em>A Thousand Faces, <em>involving a group of super-powered teenagers in high school, when I said to myself, there is so much more to this story then simple small episodes. So, I took these characters, and actually wrote a novel which was recently published by L&amp;L Dreamspell Publishing. </em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>The comic came about as I was trying to create some promotional material. So, I wrote a very short script, which was actually a scene from my novel, and I gave it to an artist to draw. I did the lettering and I put the comic up on my website, and on Facebook. I was quite happy with it, but not satisfied, so I wrote some more scripts, some direct scenes from the novel, and others tie-in stories. So far, the four episodes I have uploaded onto WEvolt have been these short comics. I decided though, only a few months ago actually, that I am going to do a longer story, two actually, because like my novel, there are two stories going on, one involving Christine, a superpowered teen who can read others&rsquo; minds, and her grandfather&rsquo;s story, set during World War II. So, I plan on doing both of the projects simultaneously, one the true High School Heroes story, and the other the Project: Hercules story. And I think it&rsquo;s found a good home on WEvolt, so for the moment, we&rsquo;ll be sticking around. <br /></em></p>

</div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>Someone, and I apologize, but I can&rsquo;t remember who it was, was handing out postcards at New York Comic Con, so, when I went home I immediately signed up and uploaded the first of the short High School Heroes tales. I got some hits, and some likes, so I decided to enter the contest. <br /></em></p>

</div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>Well, I have plenty of friends on Facebook, and I&rsquo;ve been essentially doing almost daily updates enticing them to click &ldquo;Like&rdquo;. Thankfully, my friends and family all want to help me out, so when I ask them, they do what they can. Also, since I teach, I have my students logging on and liking my pages. They are very into it, and would prefer reading these comics rather than what&rsquo;s in their literature book. (I still don&rsquo;t know whether to be honored by that, or upset they don&rsquo;t like the classics). Also, putting the contest up on my messageboards didn&rsquo;t hurt either, even though I got the fewest &ldquo;Likes&rdquo; off the message boards, they still counted for the contest, which is all that matters.&nbsp; <br /></em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 39pt;">6)<span style="font: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you making any changes to your strategy to win the next three weeks and win the round?</p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>I honestly don&rsquo;t know. Since the goal is to get as many fans as possible, I&rsquo;m going to keep trying to expand my &ldquo;marketing&rdquo;. But, as they say, if you find something that works, stick with it. I plan on sticking with what I have been doing, but I will be broadening my proverbial horizons. By the way, if you&rsquo;re reading this, go and &ldquo;Like&rdquo; my comic!!</em></p>

<p style="margin-left: 39pt;">7)<span style="font: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What general tips do you have for a new webcomic creator?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>I can only really tell from the writer&rsquo;s point of view, since my own artwork is utter crap. As I writer, I think the most important thing is finding a good artist to work with. If you&rsquo;ll notice, the first four episodes of my webcomic all have different artists. This is mainly because I was trying out different people. I think I have found the artist I&rsquo;m going to forge a permanent relationship with, but I&rsquo;m not going to say yet. </em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>Also, as far as writing goes, if you have little experience writing your own comic, start small. Do a one or two page comic, then a six or eight page. Don&rsquo;t go for the hundred page graphic novel on your first shot &ndash; it&rsquo;s too big of a task. </em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>And above all, have fun doing it. If you aren&rsquo;t having fun, then why do it? </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;">8)<span style="font: 7pt ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where does High School Heroes go from here?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>I think I answered this earlier, sorry about that. But anyway, High School Heroes, is a novel and can be purchased on Amazon.com, BN.com and other such websites. The sequel of High School Heroes will probably hit bookstores a year from now. As far as the comic goes, as I already said, it will be split into two projects: High School Heroes and Project: Hercules. I will publish these on WEvolt, but will probably also try and find a publisher for them. And if all else fails, I&rsquo;ll print them myself. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>I&rsquo;ve only been a member of WEvolt since the beginning of October, but I can say that this is a great website. I&rsquo;m glad you guys created it. </em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt;"><em>As far as the Rumble, I hope we get twice as many competitors in the weeks to come. This competition has the potential to draw in some truly great comics and get some exposure for writers and artists alike.&nbsp;</em></p>
