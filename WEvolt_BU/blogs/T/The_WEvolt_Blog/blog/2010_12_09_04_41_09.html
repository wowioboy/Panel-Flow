Today&rsquo;s  post is about the best of the best on WEvolt. We want to focus on the  stories that the fans are loving on WEvolt and see if a quick review  will get you to give these a look also. So let&rsquo;s do a break down of the  top 5. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll cover the other half of the Top Ten comics at  WEvolt!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1  The Path: What was once amazing, is now even better. James Riot has  relaunched and reloaded the path and it's jaw-dropping. Head on over,  take a look.&nbsp;Cthulhu, Arthurian legend, action, adventure, great art.  Really, what more do you need?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2  High School Heroes: James Mascia's latest story arc, "Strong" is  arguably the best art the series has seen. Throw in some character  sketches from Jason and you've got a ton of eye candy to go with his  great story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#3  Phinmagic: Proving that your first name doesn't have to be "James" to  be popular on WEvolt is Barry. But ten years of punching this story out  with great art is a mountain of fantastic material to dig into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#4  Mohagen: Arguably the best strip comic on WEvolt. Hilarious, dark and  beautifully drawn. How interesting is life in a fish bowl? Wait and  see.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s only fault is that I can&rsquo;t read it everyday, but a strip this  well executed can&rsquo;t be rushed. It takes time so savor, enjoy, and damn  it vote!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5  Olive Peril:&nbsp;Is one of our Arcana titles. It&rsquo;s a pro comic brought to  you for free by WEvolt and it&rsquo;s damn good. I read it daily. Girl gets  stuck in a crazy situation and&hellip;um a fairy thing helps her out. Kinda  sorta, hard to explain, have to read it for yourself. Beautifully drawn  and such a great read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check back tomorrow for your other half of awesome!
