<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Project Wonderful Part 1: What is Project Wonderful?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This introduction will provide basic information on what Project Wonderful is and how to get started marketing your comic.&nbsp; Next week&rsquo;s Part Two will be about how use the Project Wonderful tools.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>What is Project Wonderful?</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Unlike most advertising channels where you pay a set fee to place your ad for a period of time or where you pay-per-ad-click, Project Wonderful uses a bidding system to place your ad on websites registered with them. The Project Wonderful site directory is primarily made up of webcomic sites and independent artists so it&rsquo;s like tapping into your target audience.<br /> <br /> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creating you Ads</strong></p>
<p>Before we jump into the mechanics of the site there are some preliminary things we must do first, and the first thing I can think of is create your advertising assets. Project Wonderful accepts static JPGs and animated GIFs, BUT not all sites allow animated advertising so keep that in mind when you&rsquo;re deciding what type of ads to create. The sizes of ads that Project Wonderful accepts are:</p>
<p>Button: 117x30</p>
<p>Square: 125x125</p>
<p>Half Banner: 234x60</p>
<p>Banner: 468x60</p>
<p>Rectangle: 300x250</p>
<p>Leaderboard: 728x90</p>
<p>Skyscraper: 160x600</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t feel you need to create ads for all of these spots, that is just what&rsquo;s available. I tell everyone you should have a button as it&rsquo;s cheap and easy to get placement, then pick one of the medium sizes (Square, Half Banner, rectangle) and one of the large sizes (half banner, banner, skyscraper), but I do find that Square and Leaderboard seem to have less placements come up.</p>
<p>Onto design, I&rsquo;m not going to go into great detail here as people have written whole books on this subject, but there are some basic criteria to follow.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the name of the comic on the ad and mention that it&rsquo;s a comic and that the viewer can read it. Viewers need to know what it&rsquo;s ad for, and what it&rsquo;s offering.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When choosing a piece of art for your ad what you need to keep front of mind is &ldquo;what is most representative of my comic?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t just mean art-wise, but also representative of you&rsquo;re story&rsquo;s tone and content.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creating a Strategy</strong></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to sit down and write out a twelve-month marketing plan, but there are some bare basics to establish before you jump into this.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establish a budget. Decide how much you&rsquo;re going to spend and over what length time period. Once you have this you can develop a bidding and campaign strategy, but we&rsquo;ll discuss those in detail in part two. For example I break my budget into weeks, and I spend the same amount each week.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Goals. If you don&rsquo;t do this in the beginning you&rsquo;re just spinning your wheels with no way to measure if what you&rsquo;re doing is successful. Is what you want simply page views?&nbsp; Maybe unique users is more important to you. Just take a minute to step back and ask yourself what you want to get from your advertising efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for part one of the Project Wonderful tutorial. In part two we&rsquo;ll get into the nuts and bolts of Project Wonderful and how it works. On one last note I would like to recommend that you now go over and check out the blog about <a href="http://www.wevolt.com/The_WEvolt_Blog/Blog/?post=eae27d77ca20db3cd#">STICKYNESS.</a> There&rsquo;s no point in paying money to get new eyeballs on your comic if they don&rsquo;t ever come back.
