<p>Also I&rsquo;d like to take a minute to encourage current creators to check out the<a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=252&amp;board=291" target="_blank"> &ldquo;Post your Milestones Here&rdquo; thread</a> in The Speakeasy on the forum. When your comic reaches some sort of milestone feel free to post it here. We&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on this forum and make sure to tweet/post about it so you&rsquo;ll get the recognition you deserve! You may even get included in our newest feature The Weekly Wrap Up!</p>
<p>Lastly there is <a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=253&amp;board=291" target="_blank">another thread</a> in The Speakeasy that needs your attention! We want to know what conventions you plan on (or would like to) attend in 2010. Next year&rsquo;s convention circuit is wide open and we&rsquo;re interested to see where our community will be migrating over the course of the year.
