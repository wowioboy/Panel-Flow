<p>So, now that Wevolt is alive and kicking we've got a chance to be part of something really great here, right? Right. The tagline "If it goes online, it goes on Wevolt" was thrown around a lot at the beginning, and it's dead on. Blogs, comics, art portfolios, photography, it all fits in here! Now, you may be thinking, "HOW THE HECK DO I USE THIS THING?!" Don't worry; we've all been there. We're going to do our best to explain how to get everything on Wevolt working properly for your comic with the least amount of bloodshed. A lot of these tutorials are going to be geared towards the comic side of things, but they can actually be applied to everything across the board. From page design to downloads and extras, we'll get you moving in the right direction to get everything you can out of the Wevolt experience!</p>
<p><strong>Before we get started, I find it helpful to have my comic's homepage open in a separate tab. That way, as I change things I can immediately refresh that tab to see if it's taken effect. It saves a lot of time. Also, be sure to save as you go. It can be REALLY easy to forget to save and a lot of hard work needs to be redone...I've done it a few times myself!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Create a New Project:</strong></p>

<p>1. After you've created your Wevolt account, simply click the &ldquo;CMS Dashboard&rdquo; from the user menu or &ldquo;Create&rdquo; from the main menu on the top of the Wevolt page. You'll come to a mostly blank page.</p>

<p>2. Here&rsquo;s where you set up the basics of your project:</p>

<p>a. Title-What your project title is, BUT remember it&rsquo;s also going to be your web address at WEvolt (The Path is <a href="../../The_Path">http://www.wevolt.com/The_Path</a>)</p>
<p>b. Content Format Type: Choice of Image or Writing/Text</p>
<p>c. Genre Type: The genre or tone of your comic/story. Choose as a many as you&rsquo;d like but 2 is recommended</p>
<p>d. Update Schedule: If you don&rsquo;t have a set schedule this can be left blank.</p>
<p>e. Secondary Content Format</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image: Comic Graphic Novel (full page format), Comic Strip, Images (portfolio), Photography</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing: Digital Blog/Journal, Short Story, Novel</p>
<p>f. Choose the overall template for your non &ldquo;Reader&rdquo; pages. If you haven&rsquo;t upgraded to pro, you only have two choices. CHOOSE WISELY, this cannot be changed after the project has been created.</p>
<p>g. Age Sensitive Content: If your content has ANY questionable content (nudity, cursing, violence, or drug use) you should click this. Think about if your project is PG-13 or above</p>
<p>4. Creating the thumbnail is pretty self-explanatory. It's the same as creating your default picture on Facebook. You upload the picture you want to use for your project thumbnail, crop, and save. Bam! Done!</p>
