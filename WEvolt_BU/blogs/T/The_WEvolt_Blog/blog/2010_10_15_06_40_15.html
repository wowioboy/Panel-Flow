<p>Two weeks ago, on October 2<sup style=\"vertical-align: super;\">nd</sup>&nbsp;the 24 Hour Comics Day Challenge was met. The challenge? To create 24 comic pages in 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comic book rock star, James Riot, creator of The Path spearheaded the challenge. He got the fantastic Pulp Fiction Comics Store in Long Beach (<a href=\"http://www.pulpfictiononline.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.pulpfictiononline.com</a>) to host every creator willing to embark on the challenge. He then assembled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://WEvolt.com\" target=\"_blank\">WEvolt.com</a>\'s Matt Kirsch to stream the entire event live connecting creators from across the country for 24 hours into one creative collective consciousness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James became the banner which all creators rallied behind for the challenge. But it turned out it was more than a challenge. It was a near impossible, mind numbing, mental breakdown inducing marathon of an event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it was also an incredible success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the country, artists stepped up to the plate and met the challenge head on. They slammed out their best 24 pages in 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Riot, will be collecting and compiling all of the comics completed at the event into a digital book to be distributed through eBook sales engine&nbsp;<a href=\"http://WOWIO.com\" target=\"_blank\">WOWIO.com</a>. All the proceeds will go to The Hero Initiative (<a href=\"http://www.heroinitiative.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.heroinitiative.org</a>/), a charity benefiting comic creators in need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you will join us next year when WEvolt unites creators from across the globe to undertake the 24 Hour Comics Day Challenge!</p>
