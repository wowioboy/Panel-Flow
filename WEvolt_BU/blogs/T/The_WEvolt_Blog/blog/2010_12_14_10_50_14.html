<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Creator Interview: Carly Mizzou</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is creator interview Tuesday. Unfortunately last week&rsquo;s Rumble winner, James Riot has already been interviewed. So whom to choose? How about CREEPY CARLY creator Carly Mizzou! Carly can&rsquo;t participate in the Rumble as she&rsquo;s the WEvolt community manager. But we thought she deserved some time in the spotlight.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>How long have you been creating comics?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Only since college. I was crushed by Stan Lee&rsquo;s &ldquo;How to Draw the Marvel Way&rdquo; and the fact they took Wolverine&rsquo;s adamatium away. So I fell out of comics and I rediscovered them through manga and found my love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>What inspired you to begin graphic story telling?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved drawing. When I was a kid I&rsquo;d make picture books about unicorns and princesses. I&rsquo;m an only child so I was frequently left to &ldquo;play in my own head&rdquo;, I think my comics are just an extension of that&hellip;wait I do Creepy Carly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Quick! Plug your comic like your life depended on it.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A sadistic little girl finds ultimate joy in murdering and maiming the local teenagers and random pets, and it&rsquo;s the cutest funniest thing you&rsquo;ve ever seen!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>Why did you enter the Rumble? How is it going so far?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ha ha conflict of interests there. I&rsquo;m not only a Hair Club member, I&rsquo;m also the community manager. (replace &ldquo;Hair Club&rdquo; with &ldquo;WEvolt&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Could you share some of your strategy for The Rumble?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Well if I could enter I&rsquo;d most certainly update as often as possible, whether it be with content or blogs. I&rsquo;d also make sure to have a bit of info about myself in my profile, THEN I&rsquo;d facebook the hell outta all of that.&nbsp; Also have some fun on twitter, and spend about $10 a week on project wonderful ads for my comic. It increases your audience 10 fold!</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>6)</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>Any unexpected results from your participation in The Rumble?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Actually, YES! I&rsquo;ve met a lot of really great new artists, and started reading a lot of comics I normally wouldn&rsquo;t be attracted to. I&rsquo;m not so much for super hero or space adventure stuff, but I have a couple that I now read!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
