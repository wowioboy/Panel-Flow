So creator Tuesday became tutorial Tuesday (still better than StirFridays) so today we have an interview with Ian Austin (writer) and Dan Butcher (artist) of Death Boy. Check out their strategies for Rumble and what inspires them to create!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long have you been creating comics?<br />IA: Since 2006. Met a great guy named Will Turner on the old View Askew board. We became mates. He asked if I wanted to write some issues of his comic (Reynard City, pure sugary win.) I agreed. Four years later, and my reign of chaos has only grown more chaotically chaotic.</p>
<p>DB: I've been drawing and creating my own comics since I was in school. Me and my freinds had a huge cast of characters between us and we'd make our our comic books by folding wads of A4 paper in half and essentially drawing just protracted fight sequences. Great days!</p>
<p><br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What inspired you to begin graphic story telling?<br />IA: It's the best medium to tell superhero stories. You get the freedom to let your imagination run wild, nicely balanced by slow and steady character development. And best of all, I get to see Dan breathe life into my scripts through the way he interprets them. You've never seen a geek smile wider than I do each time I see Dan somehow take a meagre swing of a punchline and score a home-run!</p>
<p>DB: I've always had an (over) active imagination and have always drawn graphic stories. The inspiration stems from reading any comic I could get my hands on when I was young.</p>
<p><br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick! Plug your comic like your life depended on it.<br />IA: Silver Age heroism meets Dark Age anti-heroes: Death Boy is a bad ass normal tearing up the streets of Paradise City and clashing with Tezzer (Alien), the Zero League (supervillains) and the drinkers, fiends and critics that seek to plague his every move.</p>
<p>DB: Death Boy - The story of a&nbsp; British 'anti-Batman' with more pop-culture references than a Edgar Wright movie. That should do it.</p>
<p><br />4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you enter the Rumble? How is it going so far?<br />IA: To create more awareness of the comic-book, and to put ourselves in a situation where we could earn some money. It's going fantastic so far, much better than I could have hoped. We've got some new fans, increased visibility, and critical burns are down 27.5%.</p>
<p>DB: Ian (the writer) has been promoting the hell out of the title... He's shouting about it on every social network out there! ...and because of that, I think we are doing ok!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you share some of your strategy for The Rumble?<br />IA: Shameless self-promotion. Give people a reason to read. And remember three important words: Always. Be. Closing!</p>
<p>DB: Just to keep producing the goods and hoping the good combination of art/story win through</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; Any unexpected results from your participation in The Rumble?<br />IA: There sure are. Made some great new contacts, discovered some great webcomics (including this crazy awesome one called Creepy Carly), had someone mention something about Death Boy fan-art, and generally had a blast beyond what I expected and hoped for.</p>
<p>DB: I say this with some trepidation, but nothing yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a great interview and WEvolt's FIRST duel creator interview. Don't forget to check out the Rumble and <a href="../../Death_Boy/" target="_blank">Death Boy</a>
