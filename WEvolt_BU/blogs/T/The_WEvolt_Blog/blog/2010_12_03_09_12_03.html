<p><strong>CONTENT ACCESS CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>On  this high note we have ANOTHER FEATURE to roll out for PRO USERS. This  one is amazing and extremely useful to Rumblers. It&rsquo;s the addition of  the Content Access Control. What does that mean?&nbsp;You get to designate  which readers get what content.There are three settings Public  (everyone), Fans(following), Super Fans(paid readers). You can set  access for individual content pieces (pages, gallery images, blog posts,  downloads) or entire content sections., like the entire blog.</p>
<p><strong>How Does This Help Me?:</strong></p>
<p>Now you can reward readers that become following fans, and give  additional bonuses to the people that are PAID readers. Think about it,  become a fan (follow the comic) get a custom avatar. Become a SuperFan  (paid users) get bonus comics, desktop wallpapers, mobile wallpapers,  avatars, custom art&hellip;whatever you can think of! If you're a PRO USER  (click here to get more information), use your PITCH PAGE under your  SETTINGS click EDIT INFO to tell your fans what content schedule you're  committing to so they will know what they will get whensubscribe to you.</p>
