</div>
<p>James  Riot is a WEvolt living legend. His highly acclaimed comic,THE PATH is  an Arthurian/Lovecraftian epic that follows Chance McGavin, a man who  may or may not be the reincarnation of King Arthur. THE PATH lives in  the WEvolt Top Ten and spends most of its time at number one. James is  now reloading THE PATH. James has brought his years of experience to  redraw, curate and color this seminal story. It looks and reads better  than ever. Now is the time to jump on THE PATH and read one of the best  webcomics around.</p>
<p>We sat down with James to find out what makes him tick.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long have you been creating comics?</em><br />As  a jackass kid scribbling on paper? Since about 1986. In a  semi-professional "I want to do this for the rest of my life" way? Since  1997. I actually had a fairly successful (successful in that it made  consistent beer money) webcomic called "Antisocial" from 1998-2002.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;"><br /><em>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What inspired you to begin graphic story telling?</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;">My  earliest memory of wanting to draw comics is from when I was a kid. My  grandfather was an artist...a proper artist, not a comic-monkey like me.  He was always painting and sketching and I always wanted to do what he  was doing because I looked up to him. One day I was given a Captain  America comic (the issue where the Falcon gets turned into a  werewolf...showing my age), started trying to do that, and have been at  it ever since. Comics have this great ability to be simultaneously  underestimated and overvalued. I've always found that interesting.&nbsp;<br /> <br /><em>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick! Plug your comic like your life depended on it.</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;">Reincarnated  King Arthur vs. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos with the fate of reality in  the balance. It's got Cthulhu in it. Now, I'm not saying he's going to  come after you if you don't read it...but I can't promise that he  won't.&nbsp;<br /> <br /><em>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you enter the Rumble? How is it going so far?</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;">Because  all the cool kids were doing it. It could be going better, my comic  always does better in print than on the web. It doesn't help that my day  job is working for an environmental clean-up company, and we've been  responding to multiple oil spills in-between a hectic con schedule...so  updates have been lacking.&nbsp;<br /> <br /><em>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you share some of your strategy for The Rumble?</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;">Bribery. Pure and simple. I've been bribing my readers with free digital downloads each week.&nbsp;<br /> <br /><em>6)&nbsp; Any unexpected results from your participation in The Rumble?</em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;">I'd love to say yes, but it's gone pretty much how I expected.</span></div>
