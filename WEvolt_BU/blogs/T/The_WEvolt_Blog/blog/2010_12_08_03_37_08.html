Hello and welcome to Wednesday!&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless  you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;hacktivist&rdquo; or involved in this Wikileaks scandal (I love me  some Sweds!) it may seem like just another day, but &ldquo;Hark! &lsquo;Tis not!&rsquo; As  your ever diligent comic service provider we have&hellip; provided another  service! You now have a NEW way to organize your comic. Now you can  divide your comic into &ldquo;Series&rdquo; &ldquo;Episodes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chapters&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip;say what?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>NEW FEATURE: Page Mover and More!</strong></span></p>
<p>Series-When your comic has several different &hellip;well series. If  the X-men was on WEvolt, each spin off would be a different series. So  Uncanny X-men, X-Men Adventures, Ultimate X-Men, X-Men: Evolved, X-Men:  Noir....you get the point. Each one of these would be an individual  SERIES.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Episode-Think of this as a story arc.&nbsp;&nbsp;A large section of your story that needs to be sectioned off, but can be divided up even smaller, like into&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chapters-this  is pretty self-explanatory. It can be entire 22 page issues or larger  or smaller chapters. However you want to break it up. Divide and conquer  people!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still gray and fuzzy on this one? Check out some people that are doing it RIGHT, like Barry over at Phinmagic&hellip;</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you scroll down you&rsquo;ll see  examples of different SERIES, and if you look in the drop down on his  reader navigation you&rsquo;ll see examples of EPISODES and CHAPTERS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So  let me guess, you love it and you wanna reorganize your comic? (Hell  *I* did!) Well it&rsquo;s even simpler than you think! Go to your CMS, click  on your project, click EDIT pages&hellip;BAM! You&rsquo;re there. On the left you&rsquo;ll  notice a few new menu options. You can use the &ldquo;New Episode&rdquo; and &ldquo;New  Series&rdquo; to do the obvious, BUT if you click &ldquo;Move Pages&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll get a  nifty new interface that lists out all of your comic pages and lets you  move them into any of these new sections you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that is how easy it is to organize your comic on WEvolt!
