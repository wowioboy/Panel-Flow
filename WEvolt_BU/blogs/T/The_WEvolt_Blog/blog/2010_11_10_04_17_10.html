<p>Week 1 kicked off with 18 competitors, a few were already WEvolt heavy lifters like James Riot&rsquo;s "The Path" or Barry Linck&rsquo;s "Phinmagic," but quite a few new guys came in and hit the ground running.&nbsp; Newcomer Scotty Richard&rsquo;s "Blaed Race" took an early lead quickly followed by IsenMike&rsquo;s "The First Law of Mad Science."</p>
<p>In the end week 1 was SWEPT by James Mascia&rsquo;s "High School Heroes," followed by "The Path" and "The First Law of Mad Science."</p>

<p>Week 2 saw new competitor, "Acting Out Comics," enter the ring. Week 2 ran through much like Week 1 had, with a few of the new comics taking an early lead, holding their own with WeVolt veterans throughout the week. Despite an intense back and forth race throughout the week, Week 2 was won by "High School Heroes," followed again by "The Path" and WEvolt veteran D.R. Croston&rsquo;s "Method Comix."</p>
