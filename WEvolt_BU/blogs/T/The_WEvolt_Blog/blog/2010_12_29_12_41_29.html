<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Comic Day Wednesday-Webcomic Pull List</span></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Comic Day Wednesday. You might or might not be thumbing through your weekly pull list of fresh new comic books. When you put them down, we thought we'd add some more to your pull list. But our suggestions are WEBCOMICS! So here&rsquo;s what we're reading and loving this week:<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.wevolt.com/Death_And_All_His_Friends/reader/episode/1/page/1/#Service%20Provider" target="_blank">Death and All His Friends</a><br />I discovered this via the Weekly Rumble and really fell in love with it. It&rsquo;s a hilarious photo comic where the creators set up scenes, photograph themselves, then use photoshop to add effects and word bubbles to create a comic.&nbsp; The tone is nonchalant and uses that to poke fun at very heavy topics like death, politics, and religion. To put it into their own words, Death, Sinner, Atheist, and others have been personified...annoyingly.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.wevolt.com/The_Deuce/reader/episode/1/page/1/#Kinmans%20Report%20%282%29" target="_blank">The Deuce</a><br />The first thing that comes to mind when I think of this black and white single panel comic is &ldquo;classy&rdquo;. Strange doings are afoot in Eliville, and The Deuce means to find them out! This story takes place circa 1920 and is full of Speakeasys, gangsters, beautiful ladies with big secrets, and film noir style mystery. If you like classic detective films this comic is a must read.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.wevolt.com/The_Matriarch/reader/episode/1/page/1/#The%20Matriarch:%20Momentous" target="_blank">The Matriarch</a><br />My final choice for the pull list is a superhero comic with a difference. The Matriarch follows a hero like you&rsquo;ve never seen, or actually you probably seen most of your life, that&rsquo;s right MOM.&nbsp; The Matriarch follows Sherry Benning a single mother and successful career woman. Her normal day consists of trying to get to work on time, taking her son to soccer practice, and pummeling a 5,000 pound dragon to save the city she lives in. That's because she lives a double life as the savior of her city, The Matriarch.<br />&nbsp;<br />There are three comics to please your reading palate. Check back next week for more good reads to pull off the web. We are always open to suggestions so feel free to post anything you&rsquo;re reading on the forum in <a href="http://www.wevolt.com/forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;board=291" target="_blank">The Speakeasy</a>, they may make next week&rsquo;s pull list!
