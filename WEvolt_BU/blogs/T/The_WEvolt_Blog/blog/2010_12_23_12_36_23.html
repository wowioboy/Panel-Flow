<p>The Home Page is the first thing your readers will see when they get to your project. It can also be a one-stop-shop for everything you want associated with your project. First, though, you need to turn it on.</p>
<p>1. Sign into your Wevolt account and click the "My CMS" from the user menu or &ldquo;Create&rdquo; from the main menu. Click on the project you want to edit.</p>
<p>2. Click on "Manage Content".</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; You'll see "Home" listed as one of the sections. Click the "Edit  Template" button next to it. Now, the page that comes up may look  foreboding, but it's really easy to navigate.</p>

<p>4. From the drop-down menu next to "Template" choose your layout from:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blog-The home will default to your blog</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader-The Home will default to your comic</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,2,3 Column-Either have 1, 2, or 3 columns for modules</p>
<p>5. Unless you really feel the need to muck about with stuff, leave the default column sizes in the "Module Column Width" boxes.</p>
<p>6. First you will need to create Modules, see the <a href="http://www.wevolt.com/The_WEvolt_Blog/blog/?post=7f100b7b36092fb10f#" target="_blank">Modules Tutorial</a> for details on creation. Once you&rsquo;ve created modules you can click and drag the "Available Modules" into the columns to the right. It's completely up to you, but I suggest leaving the "Latest Page" module in whichever column you plan to make the biggest. That will feed the image of your latest live page into that module and make it just big enough that readers will want to click it for a better look. How cool is THAT?! Past that, you can and should arrange your modules however you want!</p>
<p>7. Click the yellow "Save Order" button.</p>
<p>8. Click the blue "Save" button. &#8232;You're done! Your project has a home page now!
