<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>New Project Index</strong></span></p>
<p>Some of you may have noticed that when you click on a project from the browse or search sections you will be directed to a fancy new Project index page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is this all about?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole purpose of this new feature it to create a unified 'Home' page for each project. So if a creator hasn't set up their own homepage, or added content modules, this index page will serve as the place to go to find out anything going on with a project. This new section also ties to WOWIO and provides links to become a SuperFan too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see what your project looks like in this new page just go to the URL:</p>
<p>http://www.wevolt.com/project/PROJECT_NAME/</p>
<p>Feedback on this feature is welcomed and encouraged. Our hope is to create a more information driven section for new readers to find out everything about a project more easily.
