<strong>Understanding the Reader:</strong></p>

<p>The way WEvolt handles the display of your comic content is a bit different than other comic communities. Think of it this way, you have pages that are ancillary to your comic, like the blog, downloads, mobile, or any custom pages you create These are fully customizable to your liking and pull from the template you&nbsp; chose when you created your comic, can have multiple columns in the main content area, and they also display the menu you set up in the design section (more about that later). Your reader pages are different. They display a menu specific to navigating your comic and can only have a single column layout. This was done to keep the &ldquo;Reader&rdquo; page&rsquo;s navigation uniform so you can jump from comic to comic and always know how to get to the menu or the next page. We&rsquo;ll dissect the reader navigation below.</p>
