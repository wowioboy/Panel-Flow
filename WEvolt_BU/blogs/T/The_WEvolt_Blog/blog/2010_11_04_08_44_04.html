<p>Last weekend was the second annual Long Beach Comic Con and several WEvolt creators, old and new, gathered together to create their own mini WEvolt Artist Alley.&nbsp; Those creators were long time high rollers James Riot of <a href="../../The_Path/" target="_blank">The Path</a>, Joey Ringtol of <a href="http://tabts-comic.com/" target="_blank">TABTS</a>, Carly Mizzou of <a href="http://www.creepycarly.com" target="_blank">Creepy Carly</a>, and new comer Chris Waterman of <a href="../../Metulhed/" target="_blank">Metulhed</a>.&nbsp; Though they were at different tables they supported each other the entire show. It was a perfect Halloween weekend without the calories or toothache!</p>

<p>James Riot and Joey Ringtoul shared a table and were drawing silly and ridiculous commissions of mystery, humor and horror (while making cat noises). This con there was a special surprise in store for James. His heroes Mike Mignola and Amanda Connor were also in the artist alley and they had heard the about the buzz generated by The Path. I could go into the details of James&rsquo; AMAZING weekend of his Life&rsquo;s Work Validated, but why repeat what he covered so well? Hear it in his words <a href="../../The_Path/blog/" target="_blank">HERE</a> at his blog. Saturday night they all gathered for the LBC Zombie Walk dressed as characters from Left 4 Dead. They lurched through the downtown streets finally ending at a movie theater for a late night showing of Shaun of the Dead. SQUEE!</p>

<p>Next was Carly Mizzou (that&rsquo;s me!) This year I was representin&rsquo; Creepy Carly and the WEvolt community which was a huge honor! I did my usual gig of drawing anyone and everyone&rsquo;s portrait for $1 in under two minutes. It&rsquo;s a bit of a personal challenge and my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Bigger than THAT though was that my comic, Creepy Carly, was nominated for a <a href="http://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Friends of LuLu</a> Best Female Character Award. It was a huge honor as Friends of LuLu is an organization that works to promote the message that comics are for everyone. I attended the ceremony and met all the organizers of event. I was up against Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&rsquo;s Ramona Flowers, what a trip! Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t win, but hey I lost to Ramona Flowers! I spent most of my time at the table, but the last 15 minutes of the con I went through the artist alley Trick-or-Treating (it was Halloween after all!) I made off like a bandit! And no I won&rsquo;t share!</p>

<p>The last (but not least) of the crew was new guy Chris Waterman. You may remember we met this guy for the first time at 24 Hour Comics Day. His story is that he&rsquo;s an art director by trade and randomly showed up for 24 hour day to breath some life into her personal artistic career. Fortunate for us he left 24 hour comic day invigorated and signed up for WEvolt. Since then James Riot has been helping mentor him in the ways of the Webcomic Jedi. LBCC was Chris&rsquo; FIRST CONVENTEION EVER! He had sketch cards and was doing commissions and having a blast. He even brought his son out to the show on Saturday and the kid was so cool even HE was drawing in sketchbooks. What a team!</p>
