<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>STICKINESS: Getting Fans To Come Back</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Let&rsquo;s talk about pro-active stickiness. That&rsquo;s things that you should be doing regularly to promote your comic on WEvolt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Hopefully you got a bunch of Likes with pro-active contact like emails and reminders. But getting those people to keep coming back without you having to hassle them? That's called STICKINESS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">People come back for one main reason:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;"><strong>New content.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">This can be content you generate, curate or simply catalyze. Let's break it down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. CONTENT YOU GENERATE</p>
<p><br /> The secret is reliability and predictability.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Create a schedule and then be really public about it. People should know which days you're updating and when that update goes live. Midday PST? 9am EST? Whenever it is, make sure it's known and that you can stick to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Places to let people know:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">1. On your homepage.</span></p>
<p>2. In your author comments.</p>
<p>3. Any blog entries.</p>
<p>4. On your Facebook page.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Get into a habit and people will fall in with you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. CONTENT YOU CURATE</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">So maybe you can't come up with content every day. That's ok. Everyone else is. There's plenty of stuff out there. Find stuff that's similar to your comic that your fans will like. Don't just grab everything you like. Only grab stuff that's similar to what you're producing. Are you doing a comic about supervillains? Find that great list of 100 things I would do if I was a supervillain: <a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Maybe your comic is inspired by someone? Send links to their work or books they might like. Become a content hub for things that are similar to your comic. People will come back every day for content similar to what you're doing that they will like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">And make sure you credit people. You want people to link to you and credit you, so do likewise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. CONTENT YOU CATALYZE</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10px;">This is the best content you can create. If you can find the magical mixture that gets conversation going on your boards and audience comments, you're laughing. The best way to do this is to keep throwing crap at the wall. Eventually some of it will stick. Be vocal. Be endearing. Be charismatic and approachable. Get people chatting and reply to everyone. Eventually you will get that rock over the hill. When it rolls down the other side in a landslide of conversation you're laughing.</span></p>
