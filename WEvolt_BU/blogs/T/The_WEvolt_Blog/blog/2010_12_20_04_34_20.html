<p>It&rsquo;s Monday again and that means we&rsquo;re going to announce another Weekly Rumble Winner. How exciting is that?! This winner really earned it, he&rsquo;s one of WEvolt&rsquo;s earliest users and his comic is ALWAYS in the top 5. Who could this be? Why it&rsquo;s Barry Linck and his now award winning comic Phinmagic! So Phinmagic takes last week and will now be moved into The Lord of the Rumble to compete with all of the winners from weeks past.&nbsp; Speaking of weeks past did you know that THIS WEEK is the final week for round two? This means after this week the Rumble goes on Christmas vacation until January 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
