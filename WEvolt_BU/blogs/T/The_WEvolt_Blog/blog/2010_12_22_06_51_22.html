<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign in to Wevolt, and click the "CMS Dashboard" from the user menu or &ldquo;Create&rdquo; from the main menu at the top of the page, click your newly created project. Next click "Edit the look of your site" from the menu.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Click "Current Skin". That will bring you to the "Site Appearance" tab.</p>

<p>3. Everything you need is right in front of you. This page may LOOK scary, with all the codes and numbers staring at you, but it's really easy to use. You can set the background image for your project, font size and color (the default size works pretty well, though), tab colors (http://www.pagetutor.com/common/bgcolors1536.html), and even the colors that links appear in your posts and modules.</p>
<p>4. Once you're done playing around with that and happy with what you've gotten done, click "Save", now we're onto the "Template Settings" section.</p>

<p>5. Click &ldquo;template Settings&rdquo; from the left menu "Header Area" and upload your comic header (The title banner you want at the top of your project's page, like the logo banner at <a href="../../Phinmagic/">www.wevolt.com/Phinmagic/</a> ), then save. The nice thing is, if you leave the "Header Link" area blank, clicking on your header will automatically bring your readers back to your Home Page (which we'll build in the next bit)!</p>
<p>6. SAVE, SAVE, SAVE! Have I mentioned you should save as you go?</p>

<p>7. Now click on the "Window Box" tab. From here, you can edit the look and feel of the module boxes that appear on your comic. Unless you REALLY want to get your hands dirty, you can leave these alone. The default settings work just fine. Then click the "Window Headers" tab. Here you can change the color of the header that's inside the module box to better suit your background image, or even add a separate background image to the module itself!
