<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>WEVOLT RUMBLE ROUND ONE RECAP</strong></span></p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" src="http://wevolt.com/blogs/T/The_WEvolt_Blog/media/HSHimage.jpg" alt="" />James Mascia&rsquo;s HIGH SCHOOL HEROES has swept the first round of the WEvolt Rumble. We couldn&rsquo;t be prouder of James and his fan base&rsquo;s hard work. Over the last four weeks they rallied, clicked and they rumbled their way to first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIGH SCHOOL HEROES is now out of the RUMBLE until the LORD OF THE RUMBLE in February. James also scores another $100 for winning the WEvolt RUMBLE and we&rsquo;re also throwing him a SIX MONTH PROFESSIONAL membership. This allows James to start getting subscribers for HIGH SCHOOL HEROES. So if you&rsquo;re a fan of HSH, and you wanna show your support for James and the great comic he creates, head on over to:</p>
<p><a href="../../superfan.php" target="_blank">http://www.wevolt.com/superfan.php</a></p>
<p>And select HIGH SCHOOL HEROES as the project you want to subscribe to. It&rsquo;s $2 per month, and James scores half of that. He&rsquo;s working his butt of to punch out pages for you and a buck a month is all he&rsquo;s asking.</p>
<p>The next four week RUMBLE round starts after Thankgiving.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also gonna reboot the rules a little to spice it up. From now on, every time you win a week you score $100 and get instant entry into the LORD OF THE RUMBLE in February. You can&rsquo;t win another week, but you&rsquo;re gonna need to keep updating if you want to win that month&rsquo;s round.</p>
<p>This will mean we will have NINE competitors next February, not three. We think this will make it more fun for everyone.</p>
<p>So rest up over Thankgiving, then come on back and get ready to click those LIKE buttons!</p>
<p>HIGH SCHOOL HEROES dominated round one, but who will take the crown in ROUND TWO and face off against HIGH SCHOOL HEROES in the LORD OF THE RUMBLE?</p>
