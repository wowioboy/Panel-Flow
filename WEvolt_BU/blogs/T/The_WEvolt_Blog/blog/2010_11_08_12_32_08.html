<strong><span style="font-size: small;">Tuesday Interview-D.R.Croston</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.5px; border-collapse: collapse;">We&rsquo;re  onto week three of the Weekly Rumble and James Mascia has swept the first  two weeks. But what about the guys working their butts off that make it  to second and third place? We&rsquo;ve interviewed D. R. Croton of Croston&rsquo;s  Method Comix a slice of life comic, and have an interview coming from  James Riot of The Path, our second and third place winners last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out what it takes to be a webcomic rockstar!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long have you been creating comics?</p>
<p>I have been creating comics since second grade art class with Mrs. Ross. She never minded that I used her class room as my personal studio.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What inspired you to begin graphic story telling?</p>
<p>In grade school I had to take speech therapy so I didn't like talk to people but I needed to communicate. I would write little notes, but sometimes that wouldn't cut it. Throw in some pictures and shazam- comics.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick! Plug your comic like your life depended on it.</p>
<p>Life is stupid and weird. My method of dealing with it is to laugh before I cry. Read Croston's Method Comix and judge how well it works yourself.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you enter the Rumble? How is it going so far?</p>
<p>I figured Riot, Adam, and Barry would take the first three rounds easily, and the fourth would be one of the other top ten comics. After reading the rules I realized a few of the top ten don't even qualify. So I entered my rank 7 comic (with only 1 fan) because I have a decent chance in the fourth round. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you share some of your strategy for The Rumble?</p>
<p>I'm coloring my comic as long as people keep clicking the like button. I put up a con sketch yesterday but only because I had been away from home all weekend.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; Any unexpected results from your participation in The Rumble?</p>
<p>I have a handful of viewers in Africa now. I only need South America to complete my collection.
