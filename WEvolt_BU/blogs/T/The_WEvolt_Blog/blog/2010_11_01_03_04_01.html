<p>From out of nowhere, High School Heroes stormed the first week of WEvolt RUMBLE SERIES!</p>
<p>In one week James not only brought HIGH SCHOOL HEROES to WEvolt, he brought his fans here. And they're not just any fans. These people were ready to click the hell out of any Like button that James could upload.</p>
<p>And click away they did.</p>
<p>James showed us that if you treat your fans right, not only will they come anywhere with you, but they will also support you when you do so.</p>
<p>The creators of High School Heroes now get the honor of being the most &ldquo;Liked&rdquo; comic on WEvolt (and associated bragging rights) and $100! Congratulations to James and all his amazing fans! Keep it up and hopefully we can see HIGH SCHOOL HEROES win Round One and enter the LORD OF THE RUMBLE!</p>
<p>Remaining competitors don&rsquo;t fret! If you didn&rsquo;t win WEEK 1, you are automatically entered into WEEK 2, and if you&rsquo;re new all together check HERE for Rumble rules and instructions.</p>
<p>Good Luck on Week 2</p>
