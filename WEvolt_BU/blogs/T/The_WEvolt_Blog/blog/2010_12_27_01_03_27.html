<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">It's an EXTRA Happy New Year for a couple of Rumble Winners!</span></strong></p>
<p>Welcome to post holiday Monday. Normally this would be a <strong>waiting-for-more-of-the-holidays</strong> kind of Monday, BUT we have big things to announce here at WEvolt like the Round Two, Week Four winner, and (drumroll please) the overall Round Two winner. So let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>
<p>The Round Two, Week Four winners not only have a great comic but they really hustled in this last week spreading the word about their comic and clamoring for those precious page &ldquo;likes&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m proud to announce that the comic creating duo, Ian Austin and Dan Butcher take the final week of Round Two with their comic <a href="http://www.wevolt.com/Death_Boy/reader/episode/1/page/1/#The%20Decision" target="_blank">Death Boy</a>! It&rsquo;s a great read and these guys really showed the powerful influence social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook have when creating buzz! Congrats guys!</p>
<p>Here it is, the moment is upon us, time to reveal the BIG Round Two Overall Winner. I am thrilled to announce that James Riot takes Round Two with <a href="http://www.wevolt.com/The_Path/#" target="_blank">The Path!</a> Between his two comics <a href="http://www.wevolt.com/The_Path/#" target="_blank">The Path</a> and <a href="http://www.wevolt.com/The_Path/reader/series/3/episode/1/page/1/#The%20Path%20Presents:%20Lancelot" target="_blank">The Path Presents: Lancelot</a> he updates SEVEN (yes, 7!) days a week with full color work. Congratulations James, and stay tuned everyone; we&rsquo;ll be releasing some EXCLUSIVE content from a past Rumble winner very soon. Gotta keep it on the hush hush for now!</p>
<p>A reminder, The Weekly Rumble is on &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; this week and will return January 3<sup>rd</sup> for a brand new round!</p>
