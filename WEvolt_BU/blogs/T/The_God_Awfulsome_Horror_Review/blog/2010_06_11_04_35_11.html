<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Well, I suppose this is my first entry, and my first ever blog. So while I knock out the first few I have no idea what the hell i am doing kinks, I should get the hang of this pretty fast. How hard can it be I mean every celebritard has one of these damn things right?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I am a huge fan of horror movies, and I suppose as this goes on you'll learn that all pretty quick. What should be know is I absolutely love gad aweful horror movies. I don't mean aweful in like the gore is so disturbing, like the hostel movies. Or the plot is so disturbing like the human centiped. No, I mean the movies are so absolutely horibble they are now some how great. THese are the movies I want to talk about here.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I will talk about some new movies, and some old movies. They will float around, sometimes you may agree with me, often times not I am sure. Alot of these movies will be one's you've never heard of, but from time to time, you might have. I think thats a fairly important thing to have in these blogs, familiarity and all. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I will try to explain what makes these seemingly horrible movies great, and I will often try to make you laugh. I hope I am succesful in both endevors. If not, well I will have failed these movies, and I suppose you aswell. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">This is really starting to sound more like a mission statement, than a blog, like I said this is my first one of these things. In time they will get better, one hopes. I wanted this first blog to give anyone reading this and idea of what this who blog will be about. When I can i will try to include trailers to these movies, sometimes that will be nearly impossible to accomplish, as alot of these movies will be strait to store self, and susequently the bargin bin release. I'd say DVD, btu alot of these have never made it to that medium, and likely sadly, never will.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I'll try to explain as much about the movie without ruining it for you should you be able to find it, and I will give you my opinions on what make them wonderful, hopefully giving you the desire to try and find them and watch them, and hopefully enjoy them as much as I do. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, if your a fan of horror movies, specifically bad ones. I hope you enjoy my blog, if not I well I hope I make you laugh with my snide commentary, and dark, dry sense of humor. Please enjoy my very tiny forray into the digital world of the blogosphere, if you like it say so, if you hate it, hey say so about that to. </span></strong></p>
