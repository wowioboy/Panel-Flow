First off, I feel that some thanks are in order...</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank my mother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank many of the teachers I&rsquo;d had in my schooling years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the fellow students in my graduating class.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d even like to thank the students of the other graduating classes that I met in my own years as a student.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the current members of the 9thWonders message board.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d like to thank the greater majority of the denizens of the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the people behind the Selective Service System.</p>
<p>I hear there are also quite a few politicians that I&rsquo;d like to thank were I ever to learn of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank reality television, along with its producers, writers, and willing viewers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank McDonald&rsquo;s, its CEOs, employees, and willing customers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank all of you sexists out there (I&rsquo;m male, if you think it matters).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank all of the Christians, out there in the world, that preach love but do not practice it.</p>
<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;d like to thank those out there that believe love equals sex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank those that have read this whole post and not yet caught on to the satirical tone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank so many people; I can&rsquo;t even think of you all.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d especially love to thank those of you who have seen something&mdash;be it a book, television show, movie, or something of that sort&mdash;which you yourself did not enjoy and then decided to pronounce to others that it was unfit of their time, convincing them to not decide for themselves. I feel you likely to have been covered already under a different category, but since I so much more wish you thanks I feel it necessary to include this section, just in case you were otherwise unsure of your eligibility or if you truly were not one of the above.</p>
<p>I wish you all to be few, though it seems you are not. I truly do thank you all, for you all make me feel so smart. I enjoy that every day I appear to myself far greater than I would without you standing beside me in humanity. I do warn you of feeling pride, however, for I do not expect my spirits much less bright on the day when I am proved wrong. In addition, I hope&mdash;oh-so-dearly do I hope this&mdash;that you might be so modest as to refuse my thanks and choose to become such that my thanks cannot be given, but till that day comes, from deep within my heart...</p>
<p>I thank you.
