I feel it must be said that you have free will. You should not feel in any way obligated to agree with me, especially if on a particular subject, my voice is the only one that you have heard.</p>
<p>I do wish for you to take me as someone with something to say, I&rsquo;d very much enjoy it if you were to agree with me, and I&rsquo;d very much appreciate your serious consideration of the things said, but, in the end, the decision lies with you as to what you shall make of what it is that I have written.
