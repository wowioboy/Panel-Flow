Alright as promised for today, I've added user groups to your NETWORKS section on your MYVOLT.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well you can create groups of your friends and give that group access to specific content on WEvolt. Currently this applies to forums and calendar events, however it will apply to ALL content on WEvolt in the coming week.</p>
<p>For instance you will be able to create project content and WEvolt windows that only those groups can see.</p>
<p>To get started just click on MANAGE GROUPS in your networks. Then create a new group. You can type in a friends name or email and they will pop up for you to select. Now you can only search your friends, so before someone can be placed in a group they need to have accepted a friend request.</p>
<p>We will be expanding this to your fans as well.</p>
<p>Have a great 4th of July weekend. Plenty more WEvolt features next week!</p>
