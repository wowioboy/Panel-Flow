So with the help of some loyal Beta testers I've been cranking away at getting the CMS stable which has been a lot of work. The bags under my eyes are growing bigger by the day. However, things are looking great. I just implemented the CMS design which looks and works so much better than before. </p>
<p>So if you haven't checked it out yet, cruise on over to the REvolt CMS and check it out!</p>
<p>We will be doing a contest next week for the final push before July 1st. We'll be offering XP bonuses for new unreported Bugs! This will be on the forums, and first come first serve. </p>
<p>Stay Tuned!
