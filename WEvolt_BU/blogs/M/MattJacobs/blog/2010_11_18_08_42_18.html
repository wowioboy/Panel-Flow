Ok, I've been really bad at updating this blog, but only because I've been so busy working on all the cool new stuff coming with WEvolt. Both new features and some great new content...some of my original stuff too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But being busy is more just an excuse than anything, so I've gotta get back on the horse and update! I'm going to take a few minutes each week (atleast) to post an update of some kind. It may be a long ramble or a quick snippet, but it will be something!</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;WEvolt features. I've been able to crank out a bunch of new stuff that has been on the to do list for a while, and I'm really excited to release in the coming weeks.<br /><br />All the following will be ready soon, some are already in place. And we'll do an announcement with a quick 'How To' for each of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Module Designer</span><br />Jason put together a bunch of new module styles and I've created a new wizard that will let you quickly change the look of your boxes. Some have had a hard time customizing modules before, this should make it much easier.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Module Creator</span><br />For those that haven't used the new module creator, give it a try on either the 'HOME' content section or READER. You can now create new modules from a list that will be constantly growing. If you have any ideas for modules, speak your mind in the forum here: <a href="../../forum/index.php?user=wevolt&amp;a=read&amp;topic=146&amp;board=149" target="_blank">MODULE MASHUP!</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Series Editor</span><br />This new feature has been requested by a couple of our long time WEvolt users JamesRiot and Phinmagic. It will add the ability for you to run spin-off / alt series from one project. So with my project Stupid Users, instead of running Spam Kills as its own project. This will now become a new series under Stupid Users, but will be only available to fans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Access Control</span><br />This feature will let you section off all your project content (even entire content sections) to be seen by either Everyone, Fans or SuperFans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the creative!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been working on a ton of creative projects with some talented people. Here is just a start of what you can expect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHROME - Sam Tung is onboard to illustrate the Chrome series. I've been wanting to get this one done for a long time now. It started as one of my first screenplays I did while going to film school. Sam has really taken his time on the design and the layouts are looking great. We will be posting stuff soon.</p>
<p>TENPACES - We just finished Episode 5 and it looks amazing. Alan Gallo and Nick Acosta did a great job finishing off the first part of this series. Now that it's in the can, I'll start posting the rest of the series next month! Finally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STUPID USERS - I'm really excited to say that I'll be finally coming back to this series to finish it. It's going to be more of a reboot actually, A new artist and even a couple new writers. This thing is going to be hilarious! I hope to start releasing content in late Jan/Feb. I'll keep you posted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with that, I'm writing an illustrated novel for WOWIO that has been a lot of fun. It wasn't my original idea, but it's a great story! I'll share more when I can. And if that wasn't enough, Jason Badower and I have been cooking up an epic series that I can't wait to show off. All I can say right now is that it's bad ass!</p>
<p>Enough rambling for me, time to get back to work.&nbsp;</p>
