So now WEvolt has been live for about 6 months. We've learned alot about what works and doesn't work and have been hard at work at planning the future of WEvolt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with that in mind, we've decided to convert the code that WEvolt is built to a new framework in Python. Wow that sounds like a lot of work! Well it is, but it is going to be worth it. Since WEvolt is part of the WOWIO family, we have 2 other sites Drunkduck.com and Wowio.com, so wouldn't it be nice if we had everything on the same system...one log in! This will open our ability to integrate with the other sites, and also start creating an API for all the sites (but that's a little futher down the line)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what does this all mean for WEvolt? Well we have released a bunch of new features and more coming by the end of the year, but then all new features will be put on hold during the conversion processes. Now that doesn't mean things won't be patched and updated as needed, but core feature will be put on hold until the next release on the new framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I've been torn about this, mostly because I find it hard NOT to code on the site. I enjoy conceptualizing something and seeing it work right away. Often I get an idea in my head 10 at night and just sit down and do it. Especially ones that come from community feedback. One thing I dig about WEvolt, and Panel Flow before it, is how it's always upgrading. But for the next month I've gotta refocus my efforts and let our new developers go to work, otherwise the conversion will never get done. Plus I need to learn a new language!</p>
<p>But for now that means I get to really start on the creative projects working with the head of Content Development at WOWIO along with Jason and the Pop Galaxy guys, to produce some awesome new content. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And while I enjoy coding, I've been so deep into it for the last four years that my creative projects have taken a back burner. But now I can get back to what brought me to LA in the first place. Telling stories!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pulled my old box of scripts out the other day and started reading through all of them. It's crazy how much I wrote back in Film School and during those first 5 years in LA. Even better is there is some great stuff in there! Though my writing has changed since then, so I think they need to be dusted off and edited.</p>
<p>Time to pull up the sleeves...
