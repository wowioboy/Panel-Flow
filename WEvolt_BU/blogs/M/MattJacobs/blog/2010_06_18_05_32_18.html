Today I'm working on some cool new features for the CMS to allow you to manage episodes and spin offs easier. This new feature will allow you to create new 'series' under your same project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I had a novel, and then adapted it to a webcomic. I could post that webcomic as a new series instead of having to create a new REvolt project. This will only be a feature for those with Pro Creator accounts. Another great suggestion from one of our creators. See we do listen to you :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also be adding in a much better system for managing REvolt modules and creating new modules for your project page. These modules will also be able to be plugged into your WEvolt page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alright...back to work.&nbsp;</p>
